A 1 x 2.5 km caldera lake on the northern side of the inner caldera drains through a narrow breach in the western caldera wall. Solfataric activity occurs at the northern lake shore and at explosion craters (one of which contains a hot crater lake with reported temperatures from 36-100Â°C) that cut the caldera-floor lava domes.

Additional lava domes in the northern part of the older caldera are considered to represent flank activity of the younger caldera.

Lava flows from descended 4-5 km SE to reach the Pacific Ocean along a broad front. The only historical eruption occurred in 1951, when local inhabitants reported weak explosive activity at the summit. Strong solfataric activity continues from the summit and several flank craters, and the SW flank geothermal field contains hot springs and geysers. A small hydrothermal explosion took place in 1992 at an exploratory well in the SW-flank geothermal field.",

Lava flows from both edifices are truncated by a large, 4-km-wide depression on the west side of the peninsula. Basaltic rocks dominate at both volcanoes over basaltic-andesite and andesitic products. Kitachirippusan has a shallow summit crater, partially filled by a small lake, that has fed lava flows down all sides; satellitic cones are located on the northern flank. Lava flows from Minamichirippusan reach the coast on both the east and west sides.

Four small closely spaced stratovolcanoes were constructed along an E-W line on the eastern side of the complex. The easternmost and highest, Medvezhii, lies outside the western caldera, along the Pacific coast. Srednii, Tukap, and Kudriavy (Moyorodake) volcanoes lie immediately to the west. Historically active Moyorodake is younger than 2000 years; it and Tukap remain fumarolically active. The westernmost of the post-caldera cones, Menshoi Brat, is a large lava dome with flank scoria cones, one of which has produced a series of young lava flows up to 4.5 km long that reached Slavnoe Lake. Eruptions have been documented since the 18th century, although lava flows from cinder cones on the flanks of Menshoi Brat were also probably erupted within the past few centuries.",

The crater of Kolokol is not well preserved, but there is no evidence of glacial erosion. Several lava flows originate from Kolokol; one of these extends almost to the Sea of Okhotsk coast; a viscous lava flow armoring the SE flank is probably the most recent. Borzov volcano, the oldest of the group, lies to the SW of Kolokol. Eruptions have been observed since the late-18th century. Berg volcano has been most active, but Trezubetz erupted in 1924.",

A 3-km-wide caldera breached widely to the SE was formed during the Pleistocene and became a center of glaciation. A small central cone capped by an andesitic lava dome was constructed within the caldera during postglacial time and forms the highest point on Simushir Island. Lava flows from the cone descend 4-5 km to the sea. Goriaschaia Sopka, previously identified as a distinct volcano, is a historically active andesitic lava dome that grew just beyond what appears to be a NE-SW erosional scarp along the NW flank. Numerous fresh lava flows with prominent marginal levees extend from the dome, with some reaching the sea. It may have formed as recently as the late-19th century; dominantly mild-to-moderate explosive eruptions have occurred since 1842.",

The current lake surface is at ~40 m elevation with the bottom ~30 m below sea level, but lacustrine sediments overlying pumice deposits indicate that the surface of an earlier caldera lake lay at 200 m above sea level. A small 500-m-diameter scoria cone, sketched by Gorshkov (1958, CAVW) that reportedly grew between 1916 and 1931, formed a peninsula extending into the lake from the NE caldera wall. Explosive eruptions in 1957 removed the cone and filled much of the NW part of the lake, including emplacement of a 350-m-wide, 40-m-high dome.",

An eruption in 1778, during which the upper third of the island was said to have been destroyed, prompted the first volcanological investigation in the Kuril Islands two years later. Incorrect reports of eruptions in 1777 and 1780 were due to misprints and errors in descriptions of the 1778 event (Gorshkov, 1970). Another powerful eruption in 1924 greatly deepened the crater and changed the outline of the island.

Evidence of additional slope failures followed by plinian eruptions are found in sea cliffs of the island. Historical explosive eruptions have occurred since the early 18th century. A central cone, Severgin, was largely destroyed during the 1933 eruption, one of the largest in the Kuril Islands during historical time. Impact of a debris avalanche into the sea from the collapse of Severgin produced a tsunami that swept the island's coast and reached Onekotan and Paramushir Islands, killing two people.

The 1018-m-high central cone of Nemo Peak is composed of two coalescing andesitic cones that were constructed at the SW side of the youngest caldera and formed in four stages beginning in the early Holocene about 9500 years ago. Construction of the central cone has left the crescent-shaped Chernoe Lake at the NE end of the youngest caldera; lava flows from Nemo Peak form the broad SW shoreline of the lake. The final activity built a lava dome that completely overtops a 350-m-wide crater and has a 150-m-wide crater at its summit. Historical eruptions of Nemo Peak date back to the early-18th century.",

The Tatarinov group of six volcanic centers is located immediately to the south, and the Lomonosov cinder cone group, the source of an early Holocene lava flow that reached the saddle between it and Fuss Peak to the west, lies at the southern end of the N-S-trending Chikurachki-Tatarinov complex. In contrast to the frequently active Chikurachki, the Tatarinov centers are extensively modified by erosion and have a more complex structure. Tephrochronology gives evidence of an eruption around 1690 CE from Tatarinov, although its southern cone contains a sulfur-encrusted crater with fumaroles that were active along the margin of a crater lake until 1959.",

The central crater is filled by a lake about 20 m deep whose shores are lined with steaming solfataras; the northern crater lies across a narrow, low barrier from the central crater and contains a small, cold crescentic lake. Historical activity, recorded since the late-18th century, has been restricted to small-to-moderate explosive eruptions from the summit craters.

The low-rimmed caldera was formed in two stages during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The first caldera-forming eruption took place about 41,500 radiocarbon years ago. The second episode of caldera formation occurred about 7600 radiocarbon years ago during one of the world's largest Holocene eruptions. A total of 140-170 km3 of material was ejected, and extensive thick pyroclastic-flow deposits from the caldera-forming eruptions blanket the area. Ash fell more than 1000 km away on mainland Asia. The eruption resulted in the formation of an 8 x 14 km wide caldera, now largely filled by Kurile Lake. The steep-sided Serdtze Alaida (Heart of Alaid), which forms a small island rising 300 m from the caldera floor in the center of the lake, is a rhyodacitic lava dome that formed at the end of the caldera-forming eruption.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcanoes of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

A period of strong silicic explosive volcanism during the mid-Holocene lasted about 800 years. A series of youthful lava flows cover much of the northern flanks. Growth of the modern cone was completed about 1900 years ago, after which a long quiescent period began.

An array of post-caldera structures is truncated by later calderas, the last three of which formed during the Holocene, about 7,900 and 5,000 BCE and about 240 CE. The latter eruption was the second largest in Kamchatka during the Holocene, and produced about 20 km3 of rhyodacitic airfall tephra and 3-4 km3 of pyroclastic flows. The eastern part of the caldera complex contains two lakes, the northern of which forms an embayment in Shtyubel' (Stubel) Crater, a low-angle cone that began forming about 1,600 years ago in the youngest caldera. The only historical eruption, in 1907, originated from Shtyubel'.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcanoes of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Holocene activity was characterized by mild-to-moderate phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions from the summit crater.

The massive complex includes about 40 cinder cones, some of which contain acid or freshwater crater lakes; three major rift zones cut the complex. Another Holocene stratovolcano is located on the SW flank. Activity during the Holocene was characterized by frequent mild-to-moderate explosive eruptions along with a half dozen episodes of major lava extrusion. Early Holocene explosive activity, along with lava flows filled in much of the caldera. Quiescent periods became longer between 6,000 and 2,000 years ago, after which the activity was mainly explosive. About 600-650 years ago intermittent strong explosions and lava flow effusion accompanied frequent eruptions. Historical eruptions have consisted of moderate Vulcanian and phreatic explosions.",

It began to form during the middle or late Pleistocene, and is flanked to the SE by Kozelsky volcano, which has a large crater breached to the NE. A large collapse scarp open to the SW was created when a major debris avalanche about 30,000-40,000 years ago buried an area of about 500 km2 to the south, underlying the city of Petropavlovsk. Reconstruction of the volcano took place in two stages, the first of which began about 18,000 years before present (BP), and the second 7,000 years BP. Most eruptions have been explosive, with pyroclastic flows and hot lahars being directed primarily to the SW by the collapse scarp, although there have also been relatively short lava flows. The frequent historical eruptions have been similar in style and magnitude to previous Holocene eruptions.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcanoes of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

A large horseshoe-shaped depression on the SE flank was the source of a large debris avalanche about 8,000-8,500 years ago that traveled 11 km E and S. The avalanche, which dammed drainages forming two lakes NE and E of the volcano, was followed by an explosive eruption and a block-and-ash flow.

Two maars, Akademia Nauk and Karymsky, subsequently formed at the southern and northern margins of the caldera lake, respectively. The northern maar, Karymsky, erupted about 6,500 radiocarbon years ago and formed a small bay.

Most seismicity preceding Karymsky eruptions originated beneath Akademia Nauk caldera, located immediately south. The caldera enclosing Karymsky formed about 7600-7700 radiocarbon years ago; construction of the stratovolcano began about 2000 years later. The latest eruptive period began about 500 years ago, following a 2300-year quiescence. Much of the cone is mantled by lava flows less than 200 years old. Historical eruptions have been vulcanian or vulcanian-strombolian with moderate explosive activity and occasional lava flows from the summit crater.",

Barany, a young stratovolcano with a youthful crater 500 m wide and 200 m deep, is located on the SE flank of Yuzhny Gamchen volcano. Barany (also spelled Baranii) has been the source of a young lava field that extends to the east and NE and was active between about 3600 and 3000 years ago. Lava domes are found on the flanks of the volcanoes; the youngest of these is Lukovitsa dome, which formed during the final stages of activity at Barany.

The 2334-m-high edifice was formed during four eruptive cycles beginning about 12,000 years ago and lasting 2000-3500 years. The largest eruptions took place about 10,000 and 8300-8400 years ago, and three periods of long-term lava dome growth have occurred. The latest eruptive cycle began about 3000 years ago with a large explosion and was followed by intermittent lava dome growth lasting about 1000 years. An explosive eruption about 1100 years ago produced a lateral blast and created a 1.0 x 0.7 km wide crater breached to the NE, inside which a small lava dome (the fourth at Kizimen) has grown. Prior to 2010, only a single explosive eruption, during 1927-28, had been recorded in historical time.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcanoes of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Three periods of intensified activity have occurred during the past 3,000 years. The latest period, which was preceded by a 1,000-year quiescence, began with the dramatic 1955-56 eruption. This eruption, similar to that of St. Helens in 1980, produced a large open crater that was formed by collapse of the summit and an associated lateral blast. Subsequent episodic but ongoing lava-dome growth, accompanied by intermittent explosive activity and pyroclastic flows, has largely filled the 1956 crater.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcanoes of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

An explosive eruption took place from the summit cone in 1890.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcanoes of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The summit of roughly 65,000-year-old Stary Shiveluch is truncated by a broad 9-km-wide late-Pleistocene caldera breached to the south. Many lava domes occur on its outer flanks. The Molodoy Shiveluch lava dome complex was constructed during the Holocene within the large open caldera; Holocene lava dome extrusion also took place on the flanks of Stary Shiveluch. Widespread tephra layers from these eruptions have provided valuable time markers for dating volcanic events in Kamchatka. Frequent collapses of dome complexes, most recently in 1964, have produced debris avalanches whose deposits cover much of the floor of the breached caldera.",

        "geologicalSummary": "Severny Cherpuk (South Cherpuk) and Yuzhny Cherpuk (North Cherpuk) are two cinder cones SW of Ichinsky volcano that comprise the largest monogenetic volcanoes of the Sredinny Range. Severny Cherpuk, 21 km SW of Ichinsky, is a double cone that was constructed along the crest of the Sredinny Range and fed massive 1.8 km3 lava flows down both sides of the range to the NW and SE. A narrow tongue of the SE flow diverted an addition 10 km to the south, for a total distance of 22 km. Yuzhny Cherpuk, 11 km SSW of Ichinsky, produced a 1.7 km3 lava flow that traveled 18 km S and then SE. The flow descended to 640 m elevation and dammed tributaries of the Ketachan River, producing three lakes. The two cones are sometimes considered to be satellitic cones to Ichinsky, but Pevzner et al. (2000) noted petrological distinctions that suggest an independent origin. Unpublished radiocarbon ages revise those in Pevzner et al. (2000) and indicate that both cones were formed about 6500 years ago.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcanoes of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The andesitic Pleistocene-to-Holocene stratovolcano, also known as Icha, contains a 3 x 5 km-wide glacier-covered summit caldera filled by a large post-caldera edifice. Two glacier-capped lava domes form the highest peaks. A dozen late-Pleistocene to Holocene dacitic and rhyodacitic lava domes circle the peak below the caldera rim. Fresh-looking basaltic-to-dacitic lava flows, some with prominent flow ridges, were erupted from flank vents and traveled up to 10-15 km. The largest Holocene eruption took place about 6500 years ago, producing block-and-ash flows that traveled up to 15 km. Fumarolic activity occurs within the caldera and on the lower N flank. In 1956 steam jets rose 250 m above the caldera fumarole field.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcanoes of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Six Holocene cinder cones, including Horgo and Dzan Tologai, are concentrated along the Sumein and Gichgeniyn river valleys at the western end of the volcanic field. The 180-m-wide crater of Horgo is breached to the south, in the direction of an associated lava flow. The Holocene cones produced thin, freshly preserved lava flows remarkable for their large numbers of ultramafic xenoliths.

The field covers a 3500 km2 flat-lying plain along the Khanuy River and in drainages to the east. The cones, including the well-preserved Togo cones about 50 km E of Khanuy, north of the settlement of Bulgan, range from about 30 to 190 m in height. The Togo cones, rich in ilmenite megacrysts and altered peridotite xenoliths, include Ikh Togo Uul (\"Great Togo Mountain\") and Baga Togo Uul \"Big Togo Mountain').

A 400-m-wide crater truncates the summit. About 360 late-Pleistocene and Holocene basaltic parasitic cones dotting the flanks of the low-angle volcano were erupted primarily along the long axis of the ENE-WSW-trending island. Most of these are scoria cones, but about 20 along the coast of the island or offshore are Pleistocene-to-Holocene tuff rings and tuff cones; lava domes also occur. Flank eruptions continued into historical time, with the final two taking place during the 11th century.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Jeju Island, a UNESCO Global Geopark property.",

The youngest volcanic feature on the isolated, 4.2 x 7.2 km island is a lava dome on the SE flank of East Cape volcano. The dome was considered by Coats (1951) to be of Pleistocene age based on morphologic considerations. Smith and Shaw (1975) suggested that the volcano may have been active within the last two thousand years, however, Holocene activity is uncertain, and the volcano may have ceased activity during the Pleistocene (Motyka et al. 1993, Nye et al. 1998).

Segula was constructed above a 100-m-deep submarine platform that extends eastward to Khvostof and Davidof islands. A submarine debris-avalanche deposit extends up to 18 km offshore to the north. The summit contains a small, poorly defined caldera that is partly overtopped on the south by a cinder cone that forms the high point of the island and on the north by extensive lava flows that reach the NE coast along a broad front. Another lava field on the SE coast originated from a cinder cone at 300 m elevation on the SE flank. No historical eruptions are known, but Nelson (1959) considered fresh lava flows on the N flank to possibly be only a few hundred years old.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Aleutian Islands, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The elliptical younger caldera is 2.7 x 4 km wide; it lies within the eastern part of the older caldera and shares its eastern and southern rim. The younger caldera partially destroyed the lava cone within the first caldera and is of possible early Holocene age. Young-looking dacitic lava flows, erupted in 1828 (Kay, in Wood and Kienle 1990), issued from the central cone within the younger caldera and from a vent on the west flank outside the older caldera. Fumarolic areas are found near the western coast, along the NW margin of the older caldera, and from the summit crater down the southern flank for a 1 km distance.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Aleutian Islands, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The high point of the island is Anvil Peak, a double-peaked late-Pleistocene cone that forms much of the island's northern part. The three-peaked Mount Cerberus (renamed Mount Young in 2023) was constructed within the caldera during the Holocene. Each of the peaks contains a summit crater; lava flows on the N flank appear younger than those on the south side. Other post-caldera volcanoes include the symmetrical Sugarloaf Peak SSE of the caldera and Lakeshore Cone, a small cinder cone at the edge of Fenner Lake in the NE part of the caldera. Most documented eruptions have originated from Young, although Coats (1950) considered that both Sugarloaf and Lakeshore Cone could have been recently active.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Aleutian Islands, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The caldera rim forms a 760-m-high arcuate ridge south and east of Kanaga; a lake occupies part of the SE caldera floor. The volume of subaerial dacitic tuff is smaller than would typically be associated with caldera collapse, and deposits of a massive submarine debris avalanche associated with edifice collapse extend nearly 30 km to the NNW. Several fresh lava flows from historical or late prehistorical time descend the flanks of Kanaga, in some cases to the sea. Historical eruptions, most of which are poorly documented, have been recorded since 1763. Kanaga is also noted petrologically for ultramafic inclusions within an outcrop of alkaline basalt SW of the volcano. Fumarolic activity occurs in a circular, 200-m-wide, 60-m-deep summit crater and produces vapor plumes sometimes seen on clear days from Adak, 50 km to the east.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Aleutian Islands, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The south flank lava dome is one of the youngest features of the northern Adak Island volcanoes. The Heart Lake lava flow west of Sweeper Cove on the SE side of the volcano is another young volcanic feature. Several Holocene ash layers on Adak Island have been attributed to Moffett volcano. Its proximity to Adak Naval Air Station makes this one of the most accessible of the Aleutian volcanoes.

Deposits from this and an older debris avalanche from a source to the south cover a broad area of the ocean floor north of the volcano. The summit lies along the eastern rim of the younger collapse scarp. Deposits from an earlier caldera-forming eruption of unknown age cover the flanks of the island to a depth up to 6 m. The small younger caldera was partially filled by lava domes emplaced in 1945 and 1974, and five small older flank lava domes, two of which lie on the coastline, were constructed along northwest- and NNW-trending lines. Hot springs, mud pots, and fumaroles occur near the head of Big Fox Creek, south of the volcano.

Sarichef has a symmetrical profile, but the less eroded Kliuchef is the source of most if not all historical eruptions. Kliuchef may have been active on occasion simultaneously with Korovin volcano to the north. Hot springs and fumaroles are located on the flanks of Mount Kliuchef and in a glacial valley SW of Kliuchef. Korovin, at the NE tip of Atka Island, is the most frequently active volcano of the complex, and contains a double summit with two craters. The NW summit has a small crater, but the 1-km-wide crater of the SE cone has an open cylindrical vent of widely variable depth that sometimes contains a crater lake or a high magma column. A fresh-looking cinder cone lies on the flank of the partially dissected Konia volcano, located on the SE flank of the dominantly basaltic Korovin. Some late-stage dacitic lava flows are present on both Korovin and Konia.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Aleutian Islands, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The 3 x 4 km westernmost caldera has a central scoria cone, Pyre Peak, which rises above the caldera rim and is the source of most of the reported eruptions. A very young basaltic field surrounds Pyre Peak, and lava flows partially fill the caldera and reach the southern coast.

Cinder cones and fissure-fed lava flows extend from the western end of the complex. The younger, 550-m-high eastern complex consists of a shield volcano capped by two nested calderas. The 3.5-km-wide Coats caldera is located within an older 10 x 13 km caldera and contains cinder cones and a lava field. Two areas of particularly youthful lava flows extend down the flank through a gap in the SW caldera rim and blanket the upper northern flank of the caldera. Vents are found on the flanks of the caldera within a kilometer of its rim. A post-caldera cone is capped by a small summit crater. The eastern center is presumably the source of the island's historical eruptions, first recorded in 1817.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Aleutian Islands, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The native name, Chuginadak, refers to the Aleut goddess of fire, who was thought to reside on the volcano. Numerous large lava flows descend the steep-sided flanks. It is possible that some 18th-to-19th century eruptions attributed to Carlisle should be ascribed to Cleveland (Miller et al., 1998).

More than 60 tephra layers from Okmok have been found overlying the 12,000-year-old caldera-forming tephra layer. Numerous satellitic cones and lava domes dot the flanks of the volcano down to the coast, including 1253-m Mount Tulik on the SE flank, which is almost 200 m higher than the caldera rim. Some of the post-caldera cones show evidence of wave-cut lake terraces; the more recent cones, some of which have been active historically, were formed after the caldera lake, once 150 m deep, disappeared. Hot springs and fumaroles are found within the caldera. Historical eruptions have occurred since 1805 from cinder cones within the caldera.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Aleutian Islands, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

Two peaks protrude from the summit plateau, and a new crater formed in 1978 cuts the summit icecap. The volcano has a somewhat of a shield-like morphology and forms one of the largest volcanoes of the Aleutian Islands. The sharp-topped, conical Pogromni stratovolcano, 6 km N, rises several hundred meters higher than Westdahl, but is moderately glacially dissected and presumably older. Many satellitic cones of postglacial age are located along a NW-SE line cutting across the summit of Westdahl. Some of the historical eruptions attributed to the eroded Pogromni may have originated instead from Westdahl (Miller et al. 1998). The first historical eruption occurred in 1795. An 8-km-long fissure extending east from the summit produced explosive eruptions and lava flows in 1991.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Aleutian Islands, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

Blocky lava flows with prominent levees were emplaced during historical eruptions from 1700-1710 and in 1796 (Marsh, in Wood and Kienle 1990). The flows radiate from a well-defined central crater and cover much of the central part of the island. Earlier volcanism perhaps 4000-5000 years ago consisted of the emission of thin, platy andesitic lava flows.

Little Pavlof is a smaller cone on the SW flank of Pavlof volcano, near the rim of Emmons Lake caldera.

The active vents lie near the summit on the north and east sides. The largest recorded eruption took place in 1911, at the end of a 5-year-long eruptive episode, when a fissure opened on the N flank, ejecting large blocks and issuing lava flows.",

The 2142-m-high volcano is almost 400 m lower than Pavlof and has a sharper-peaked summit. Some sources attributed a period of intermittent eruptive activity from 1762 to 1786 CE to Pavlof Sister, but other sources consider this event to have been from Pavlof volcano.

At least 40 explosive eruptions have been documented during the past 10,000 years, making it the most active volcano of the eastern Aleutian arc. A dominantly andesitic pre-caldera volcano was constructed above basement Mesozoic and Tertiary sedimentary rocks that are exposed in the caldera walls to elevations of about 610 m. The ice-free caldera floor contains many pyroclastic cones, tuff cones, maars, and lava domes. Surprise Lake on the NE side drains through The Gates, a steep-walled breach on the east side of the 1-km-high caldera rim that was the site of catastrophic draining of a once larger lake about 1850 years BP. Vent Mountain and Half Cone are two long-lived vents on the south-central and NW caldera floor, respectively. The first and only confirmed historical eruption took place in 1931 from vents on the west and SW caldera floor.",

Brief ash eruptions were reported in July 1971 and August 1998.

The elliptical West Maar, which was the first to form, is 105 x 170 m wide and 35 m deep. The other maar, 600 m to the east, is 300 m wide and 70 m deep. Both maars are now filled by crater lakes; the eastern lake encircles a 49-m-high lava dome that was emplaced at the end of the eruption. Base surges were directed primarily to the NW. Juvenile material from the Ukinrek eruptions was of mantle-derived olivine basaltic composition. The dacitic Gas Rocks lava domes, of Quaternary age, are located on the shores of Becharof Lake, 3 km N of Ukinrek maars and were the site of a phreatic eruption about 2,300 years ago.",

The three westernmost summits are glaciated and of primarily Pleistocene age, but the East Mageik summit cone was the source of at least six Holocene eruptive episodes and fed Holocene lava flows that descended toward Katmai Pass and blanket the NE-to-SE flanks of the volcano. A young, 300-m-wide explosion crater between the east and central summits that formed about 2400-2500 years ago contains a shallow, acidic lake and many superheated fumarole jets. Three Holocene debris avalanches from south-flank failures descended into the Martin Creek drainages, one perhaps reaching the coast.

The summit complex is located 3-5 km SE of Novarupta volcano, and merges along a ridge to the NE with Katmai. The three oldest Trident volcanoes are glaciated and Pleistocene in age, while the youngest, Southwest Trident, was formed during historical time. Eruptions migrated through time from the NE to the SW. In 1953 a new lava dome began growing on the SW flank of Trident I volcano. A series of thick andesitic lava flows were erupted between 1953 and 1968, forming a cone with 400-800 m of local relief. Periodic explosions took place until 1974, and the current summit contains a 350-m-wide crater. Some of the distal lava flows from West Trident stratovolcano collapsed into the Novarupta vent during its 1912 eruption.",

The edifice had four NE-SW-trending summits, most of which were truncated by the 1912 collapse. Two or more large explosive eruptions took place during the late Pleistocene. Most of the two overlapping pre-1912 Katmai volcanoes are Pleistocene, but Holocene lava flows from a flank vent descend the SE flank of the SW edifice into the Katmai River canyon. The steep walled young caldera has a jagged rim that rises 500-1,000 m above the caldera floor and contains a deep lake. Lake waters have covered a small post-collapse lava dome (Horseshoe Island) that was seen on the caldera floor at the time of the initial ascent to the caldera rim in 1916.",

The NE side of the Falling Mountain lava dome of the Trident volcanic cluster, as well as Broken Mountain and Baked Mountain, was removed by collapse of the Novarupta depression, which is marked by radial and scalloped arcuate fractures. Much larger collapse took place at Katmai volcano, 10 km E, where a 3 x 4 km caldera formed in response to magma reservoir drainage toward Novarupta.",

A Holocene volcano was subsequently constructed within the 1.5-km-wide scarp left by the emplacement of a large SW-flank debris avalanche. Nested cones with three concentric craters mostly fill the scarp, and thick, blocky lava flows blanket the SW flanks of the volcano below the collapse scarp. In contrast to the more silicic centers of the Katmai area along the crest of the range, lava flows from Griggs are dominantly andesitic in composition, and dacitic lava flows are uncommon. No eruptions have been observed, but noisy fumarolic jets near the summit can be heard from the valley floor.",

Two small andesitic-dacitic stratovolcanoes, SW Snowy and NE Snowy, originated about 200,000 years ago. Only NE Snowy has been active during the Holocene. Late-Holocene collapse of this volcano produced a large debris avalanche that traveled to the north and left a large breached crater inside which a blocky lava dome was constructed. Peat beneath an ash layer thought to be associated with the the lava dome was radiocarbon dated at about 250 Â± 70 years ago. No historical eruptive activity has been documented, but fumarolic activity has been observed at NE Snowy. A zone of persistent diffuse shallow seismicity is located on and NW of the volcano.",

Fumaroles are located on the NE wall of the 160 x 200 m wide crater lake; some are subaqueous and produce turbulence on the surface of the blue-green lake. The fumaroles, which are actively depositing sulfur, were all at the pressure boiling point in 1982 and heated up to 114-118Â°C in 1991. Unglaciated and relatively uneroded lava flows are found on the NW flank. The age of the most recent eruptions is not known, but Nye et al.

Few lava flows are exposed; the flanks consist mainly of debris-avalanche and pyroclastic-flow deposits formed by repeated collapse and regrowth of the summit. The latest episode of edifice collapse occurred during Augustine's largest historical eruption in 1883; subsequent dome growth has restored the volcano to a height comparable to that prior to 1883. The oldest dated volcanic rocks on Augustine are more than 40,000 years old. At least 11 large debris avalanches have reached the sea during the past 1,800-2,000 years, and five major pumiceous tephras have been erupted during this interval. Historical eruptions have typically consisted of explosive activity with emplacement of pumiceous pyroclastic-flow deposits followed by lava dome extrusion with associated block-and-ash flows.",

Major glaciers radiate from the summit, and valleys below the summit contain debris-avalanche and lahar deposits. Only a few major Holocene explosive eruptions have occurred from the deeply dissected volcano, which lacks a distinct crater. Most of the reports of historical eruptions may represent plumes from vigorous fumaroles E and SE of the summit, which are often mistaken for eruption columns (Miller et al., 1998). Eruptions producing pyroclastic flows have been dated at as recent as about 300 and 140 years ago, and elevated seismicity accompanying dike emplacement beneath the volcano was recorded in 1996.",

The volcano was constructed beginning about 890,000 years ago over Mesozoic granitic rocks of the Alaska-Aleutian Range batholith. Collapse of the summit 13,000-10,500 years ago produced a major debris avalanche that reached Cook Inlet. Holocene activity has included the emplacement of a large debris avalanche and clay-rich lahars that dammed Lake Crescent on the south side and reached Cook Inlet about 3,500 years ago. Eruptions during the past few centuries have affected only the Drift River drainage on the north. Historical eruptions have originated from a vent at the north end of the 1.8-km-wide breached summit crater. The 1989-90 eruption had severe economic impact on the Cook Inlet region and affected air traffic far beyond the volcano.",

Bogoslof Hill and Hutchinson Hill, forming isolated Northeast Point connected by a low narrow isthmus to the rest of the island, were formed during the Pleistocene.

The basaltic-to-dacitic field is dominated by the large composite cones of Mount Edgecumbe, Crater Ridge, and Shell Mountain. This Pleistocene-to-Holocene system is 16 km E of the Queen Charlotte-Fairweather transform fault separating the North American and Pacific plates. Mount Edgecumbe is a stratovolcano with a well-defined crater, and is the largest edifice of the field. Crater Ridge is truncated by a 1.6-km-wide, 240-m-deep caldera. These and other vents are oriented along a SW-NE line. Volcanic activity originated about 600,000 years ago along fissures cutting Kruzof Island. A series of major silicic explosive eruptions took place about 9,000-13,000 radiocarbon years ago. The latest dated eruptions were phreatomagmatic explosions during the mid-Holocene, and all postglacial activity has been pyroclastic. Reports of observed eruptions are unsubstantiated.",

Undisturbed cinder cones and lava-flow surfaces at Painted Peak on SE Revillagigedo Island and elsewhere indicate that most of the activity was post-glacial (Brew, in Wood and Kienle, 1990).

It consists of a sequence of valley filling alkaline olivine basalt and basanitic lava flows succeeded by construction of three nephelinitic pyroclastic cones and lava flow aprons. The Ne Ch'e Ddhawa pyroclastic cone (Wootten's Cone) is composed primarily of hyaloclastite tuffs, breccias, and pillow breccias erupted subglacially during the late Pleistocene (Jackson, 1989). The youngest cone, Volcano Mountain, produced young nephelinitic lava flows that remain unvegetated and appear to be only a few hundred years old. However, dating of sediments in a lake impounded by the lava flows indicated that the youngest flows could not be younger than mid-Holocene and could be early Holocene or older (Jackson and Stevens, 1992).",

Placer miners working in the region at the end of the 19th century reported an eruption from the Ruby Mountain area about 80 km S of Gladys Lake (Hickson et al., 1994; Edwards et al., 1996) during which ash fell for several days and the miners were able to work at night due to incandescent glow.

Following extensive glacial dissection and emplacement of late-Pliocene silicic lava domes, lesser activity continued into the Quaternary. More than 20 Tertiary-to-Holocene eruptive centers have been identified in the central portion of Level Mountain and on its flanks. The broad dissected summit region consists of trachytic and rhyolitic lava domes and was considered to have several minor basaltic vents of postglacial age (Hamilton and Scafe, 1977), although Edwards and Russell (2000) considered Holocene activity to be uncertain.",

The 7.5 million-year-old (Ma) Armadillo Peak stratovolcano at the south end of the complex is overlapped by the Ice Peak central volcano, which was formed during the early Pleistocene, and contains a caldera largely destroyed by glaciers. The Mount Edziza stratovolcano on the north was formed about 1.0-0.9 Ma. A 2-km-wide, ice-filled caldera truncates its summit; lava domes were subsequently emplaced around its periphery and lava lakes ponded within the caldera and overflowed its rim. Numerous ice-contact features and products of subglacial eruptions are found in the Mount Edziza complex. More than 30 Holocene pyroclastic cones, primarily of basaltic composition, are located on Mount Edziza and the adjacent Spectrum Range, some of which are younger than about 1,300 years before present. Large areas of Holocene lava flows of the postglacial Big Raven Formation are located north of Mount Edziza, forming the Desolation Lava Field, and south and SW of Ice Peak, forming the Snowshoe Lava Field.",

More than 90% of the volcano, which dates back to at least 100,000 years, consists of interlayered peralkaline phonolitic and trachytic lava flows and hyaloclastites. At least one subaerial explosive eruption produced a welded and unwelded ignimbrite sequence on the north side.

The second stage produced a large hyaloclastite scoria mound erupted beneath the Cordilleran ice sheet during the late Pleistocene. The final activity occurred about 7200 years ago, forming a compound subaerial basanitic cinder cone that overtopped the hyaloclastite mound and produced two small lava flows that traveled about 1 km W. An airfall tephra blanket extends several kilometers to the north and east of the cone. Mining of the red cinder and scoria deposits began in the early 1990's.",

A lava flow from Dragon cone is radiocarbon dated at about 7,600 years ago, and flows from Flourmill, Kostal, and Spanish Lake Cones rest on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, suggesting an early Holocene age.

The bulk of the complex appears to have been erupted between 100,000 and 500,000 years ago, but postglacial andesitic and basaltic-andesite cones and lava flows are also present. Anomalously old Potassium-Argon (K-Ar) dates of 1.0 and 1.1 Ma were obtained from a lava flow in the postglacial Pashleth and Machmel Creek valleys (Green et al., 1988). This flow is clearly much younger than the K-Ar date, and high-energy glacial streams have only begun to etch a channel along the margin. A radiocarbon date from barnacles 8.5 km upstream from the mouth of Machmel River, and buried by the flow, yielded an age of 12,200 Â± 140 years (Blake, 1985). This is a maximum age for the flow, which could be much younger (Hickson and Edwards, 2001).",

An initial period of volcanism 0.51-0.22 million years ago was followed after a period of quiescence by construction of a conical plug dome and breccia pile at the south summit, Atwell Peak. Retreat of the ice cap left the W flank unsupported, and it collapsed in a series of landslides, exposing the core of the volcano. Lava flows from Dalton Dome north of Atwell Peak subsequently flowed down the scarp. Subglacial flank centers such as Eanastick (Enostuck) Meadow, Glacier Pike, and Paul Ridge were also formed during the late Pleistocene. The final activity formed the Opal Cone on the SE flank and the lengthy Ring Creek lava flow, which filled a glaciated valley on the S flank during the early Holocene (Mathews, 1958; Brooks and Friele, 1992).",

Vents in the Cheakamus Valley formed a 22-km-long lava flow sequence prior to 50,000 years before present that was topped by esker-like flows of late Pleistocene age. The youngest lava flows from Pali Dome West and from the subglacial Slag Hill volcano north of Mount Cayley were not impounded by ice at low elevations, implying that they erupted after the end of the Fraser Glaciation (less than 10,000 years ago).

Early settlers in the Puget Sound region as far away as Victoria, British Columbia, observed 19th-century activity, all of which consisted of relatively minor phreatic eruptions. Sherman Crater, the historically active crater immediately south of the summit, has been the site of increased steam emission since 1975.

Rainier has produced eruptions throughout the Holocene, including about a dozen during the past 2,600 years; the largest of these occurred about 2,200 years ago. The present summit cone is capped by two overlapping craters. Extensive hydrothermal alteration of the upper portion of the volcano has contributed to its structural weakness; an active thermal system has caused periodic melting on flank glaciers and produced an elaborate system of steam caves in the summit icecap. Reported uncertain 19th-century eruptions, including a possible but not confirmed phreatic eruption in 1894, have not left identifiable deposits.",

The glacially eroded volcano has had at least three major eruptive periods during the past 15,000 years. The last two occurred within the past 1,800 years from the central vent high on the SW flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily to the south and west along the Sandy and Zigzag rivers. The last major eruptive period took place beginning in 1781 CE, when growth of the Crater Rock lava dome was accompanied by pyroclastic flows and lahars down the White and Sandy rivers. The Sandy River lahar deposits extended to the west as far as the Columbia River and were observed by members of the 1804-1805 Lewis and Clark expedition shortly after their emplacement. Minor 19th-century eruptions were witnessed from Portland.",

Jefferson was constructed in two episodes interrupted by extensive glacial erosion. The first of these, beginning about 290,000 years ago, produced an andesitic-to-dacitic volcano possibly higher than the current summit. Dacitic lava domes were emplaced during a second cycle beginning about 70,000 years ago which included ash flows that traveled 15 km E and W. Several Holocene cinder cones near the Cascade crest south of Jefferson have produced lava flows that traveled down glacially carved valleys, including those from Forked Butte and North Cinder Peak. The most recent eruption, from a cinder cone on the flank of the South Cinder Peak cone, produced a lava flow that traveled west into Marion Lake about 1,000 years ago.",

Explosions through pre-existing bedrock about 1300 years ago deposited basaltic bombs and cinders and spread a tephra blanket to the east and SE during perhaps the youngest eruption in the Santiam and McKenzie Passes region. The eruption created an elongated, steep-walled crater with a low rim that rises about 50 m above adjacent topography. The crater is now filled by the 0.3 x 0.8 km wide Blue Lake, immediately west of the popular recreation area of glacial moraine dammed Suttle Lake. A chain of spatter cones 6 km to the SSW and about 4 km NE of Mount Washington, is aligned with Blue Lake crater and has ejecta that are petrographically similar to that from Blue Lake and may have been erupted at the same time.",

The Jack Pine vent at the northern end of the field is compositionally distinct from the rest of the volcanic field and is considered to have been erupted about 4,000 years earlier.

All Three Sisters stratovolcanoes ceased activity during the late Pleistocene, but basaltic-to-rhyolitic flank vents erupted during the Holocene, producing both blocky lava flows north of North Sister and rhyolitic lava domes and flows south of South Sister volcano. Glaciers have deeply eroded the Pleistocene andesitic-dacitic North Sister stratovolcano, exposing the volcano's central plug. Construction of the main edifice ceased at about 55,000 yrs ago, but north-flank vents produced blocky lava flows in the McKenzie Pass area as recently as about 1600 years ago. Middle Sister volcano is located only 2 km to the SW and was active largely contemporaneously with South Sister until about 14,000 years ago. South Sister is the highest of the Three Sisters. It was constructed beginning about 50,000 years ago and was capped by a symmetrical summit cinder cone formed about 22,000 years ago. The late Pleistocene or early Holocene Cayuse Crater on the SW flank of Broken Top volcano and other flank vents such as Le Conte Crater on the SW flank of South Sister mark mafic vents that have erupted at considerable distances from South Sister itself, and a chain of dike-fed rhyolitic lava domes and flows at Rock Mesa and Devils Chain south of South Sister erupted about 2000 years ago.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Three Sisters, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The youthful basaltic-andesite and basaltic Mount Bachelor volcanic chain was formed in four eruptive episodes dating back to about 18,000-15,000 years before present (BP). Construction of the NNW-SSE scoria cone chain south of Mount Bachelor was completed by about 12,000 years BP. The 2763-m-high Mount Bachelor (formerly known as Bachelor Butte) on the north topographically dominates the chain and is one of its youngest features. The latest activity from the chain produced early Holocene or latest Pleistocene lava flows on the east side of Sparks Lake erupted from scoria cones on the NNE flank and lava flows from Egan scoria cone on the north flank of Mount Bachelor that slightly preceded the eruption of the Mazama ash from Crater Lake about 7700 years ago.",

Caldera collapse is thought to be associated with major ash deposits from about 0.5 and 0.3-0.5 Ma. These eruptions were preceded by the emplacement of numerous mafic cones and vents, and silicic lava domes and flows, many of which are aligned NNW and NNE parallel to regional fault zones. Six major eruptions from the early Holocene to about 1,300 years ago have included both basaltic lava flows from flank vents, the explosive ejection of rhyolitic pumice and pyroclastic flows, and the extrusion of obsidian flows within the caldera.",

The cone-building stage, during which at least five andesitic and dacitic shields and stratovolcanoes were constructed, took place between about 420 and 40 thousand years ago (ka). A series of rhyodacitic lava domes and flows and associated pyroclastic rocks were erupted between about 30 ka and the climactic eruption. The explosive eruptions triggering collapse of the 8-10 km wide caldera about 7500 years ago were among Earth's largest known Holocene eruptions, distributing tephra as far away as Canada and producing pyroclastic flows that traveled 40 km from the volcano. A 5-km-wide ring fracture zone is thought to mark the original collapse diameter. The deep blue waters of North America's second deepest lake, at 600 m, fill the caldera to within 150-600 m of its rim. Post-caldera eruptions within a few hundred years of caldera formation constructed a series of small lava domes on the caldera floor, including the partially subaerial Wizard Island cinder cone, and the completely submerged Merriam Cone. The latest eruptions produced a small rhyodacitic lava dome beneath the lake surface east of Wizard Island about 4,200 years ago.",

A series of young eruptions lasting a few hundred years began about 10,500 years before present (BP) and produced 5 km3 of basaltic lava. Nine Holocene eruptions clustered during three eruptive episodes at about 5000, 3000, and 1000 years ago produced a chemically varied group of basaltic lava flows from flank vents and silicic obsidian flows from vents within the caldera and on the upper flanks. The last eruption produced the massive Glass Mountain obsidian flow on the E flank about 900 years BP. Lava Beds National Monument on the N flank of Medicine Lake shield volcano contains hundreds of lava-tube caves displaying a variety of spectacular lava-flow features, most of which are found in the voluminous Mammoth Crater lava flow, which extends in several lobes up to 24 km from the vent.",

Activity spanning about 825,000 years began with eruptions of the Rockland caldera complex and was followed beginning about 590,000 years ago by construction of Brokeoff stratovolcano. Beginning about 310,000 years ago activity shifted to the north flank of Brokeoff, where episodic, more silicic eruptions produced the Lassen dome field, a group of 30 dacitic lava domes including Bumpass Mountain, Mount Helen, Ski Heil Peak, and Reading Peak. At least 12 eruptive episodes took place during the past 100,000 years, with Lassen Peak being constructed about 27,000 years ago. The Chaos Crags dome complex was constructed about 1100-1000 years ago north of Lassen Peak. The Cinder Cone complex NE of Lassen Peak was erupted in a single episode several hundred years before present and is considered part of the Lassen volcanic center (Clynne et al., 2000). The 1914-1917 eruptions of Lassen Peak began with phreatic eruptions and included emplacement of a small summit lava dome, subplinian explosions, mudflows, and pyroclastic flows.",

Explosive eruptions began more than 50,000 years ago from now-buried vents, but almost all of the exposed domes and flows are of Holocene age. Activity propagated both north and south from the center of the chain during the late Holocene. The latest eruptions occurred nearly contemporaneously about 600 years ago from the Panum Crater area at the northern end of the Mono Craters and from the Inyo Craters to the south, producing a series of tephra rings and obsidian lava domes and flows accompanied by deposition of locally extensive tephra layers and the formation of several phreatic explosion craters at the southern end of the Inyo Craters. The latest eruptions at Inyo Craters about 600 years ago produced explosive eruptions accompanied by formation of the South Deadman, Obsidian Flow, and Glass Creek rhyolitic lava domes and lava flows. The Inyo Crater Lakes are small phreatic craters that formed during this eruption on the south flank of the Pleistocene Deer Mountain rhyolite dome of the Long Valley caldera.",

The latest magmatic eruptions took place about 57,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain is surrounded by at least 35 mafic vents that are part of the same magmatic system and include Red Cones, two closely spaced basaltic cinder cones SW of Mammoth Mountain and SE of Devils Postpile National Monument. The cones, whose name derives from colorful scoria deposits, are unglaciated and were radiocarbon dated at about 8,500 years ago. Phreatic eruptions, distinct from those at South Inyo Craters, took place about 700 years ago from vents on the north side of Mammoth Mountain.

Little Hebe Crater, the second youngest vent located immediately south, is a small tuff cone with a 100-m-wide crater overlain by pyroclastic-surge deposits. At least a dozen craters are located within an area of 3 km2, and bedded pyroclastic-surge deposits cover an area of 15 km2. Early scoria cone formation was followed by hydrovolcanic explosions that formed two clusters of explosion craters and tuff rings. Field work and revised dating (Calzia et al., 2016; Fierstein et al., 2016) based on paleomagnetic and 10Be evidence has shown that the craters were formed during a single short-lived phreatic, phreatomagmatic, and magmatic eruptive episode about 2,100 years ago.",

The age of the Salton Buttes has variously been considered to be late Pleistocene or early Holocene based on different dating techniques. Recent paleomagnetic dating calibrated by radiocarbon ages suggests that the Salton Buttes domes were erupted during an interval of about 500 years between about 2300 and 1800 years ago, with the possible exception of Mullet Island at the northern end of the field, which could be as much as 5000 years older. The present-day saline Salton Sea was formed in the early 20th century by unintended flooding into the basin formerly occupied by Pleistocene Lake Cahuilla Lake during diversion of the Colorado River for irrigation purposes.

A single radiocarbon age of 10,130 Â± 350 years was obtained for lava flows here (Kuntz et al., 1986). Black Butte Crater caps a lava shield at the NE end of the flow field. The vent area contains a complex lava lake that forms a six-part flower-petal like depression with steep walls up to 30 m high that covers an area of 2 km2. A lava tube and channel system extending 5 km SE of the crater displays both roofed and collapsed portions. The Big Wood and Little Wood rivers follow the northern and southern margins of the distal part of the lava flow, respectively. The voluminous flow diverted the river channels so that they now join 40 km W of their former confluence.",

Several lines of NE-SW-trending cinder cones occur within the volcanic field, with the youngest flows being located near Panguitch Lake on the north and Navajo Lake on the south. Navajo Lake formed when a thick blocky flow dammed Duck Creek. Young lava flows, many of which are fissure fed, have distinct margins and covered or diverted stream drainages, which have for the most part not been reestablished across the flows. Although the precise age of the lava flows is not known, the oldest trees on the youngest flows at Panguitch Lake date to about 1050 CE (Gregory, 1949), consistent with legends of the Southern Paiute (who arrived in the area about 1000 CE) noting ejection of fiery rocks and molten lava flows (Palmer, 1957).",

The youthful-looking flow originated from a broad low basaltic shield on the floor of the Tularosa Basin, east of the Rio Grande Rift, topped by Little Black Peak, a small cinder cone. The 4.2 km3 tube-fed pahoehoe flow covered 330 km2 and has a width that ranges from 1 km in the central neck region to 5 km in the proximal and distal portions. The flow was inferred to have been emplaced during a single long-duration eruption estimated to have lasted 2-3 decades. A surface exposure age of about 5200 BP was obtained for the Carrizozo lava flow, the second youngest in New Mexico. An older lava flow traveled 16 km S and 11 km E from Broken Back crater.",

The McCartys flow was recorded in native legends and was thought to have been erupted about 1,000 years ago, but radiocarbon dating indicates an age of about 3,000 years before present. The only other dated flow of Holocene age originated from Bandera Crater about 9,000-10,000 radiocarbon years ago.

Small scoria cones were constructed along a NNE-SSW line on either side of the maar. Small lahars preceded eruption of a basaltic lava flow that traveled 3 km down two narrow V-shaped valleys and spread out onto the floodplain of the Eagle River, diverting the river to the south side of the valley.

The summit is marked by an unusual rectangular-shaped caldera (3 x 8 km) that lies between two rift zones and is estimated to have formed about 31,000 years ago. The caldera is breached to the SE and is defined on three sides by boundary faults of up to 150 m relief. Hydrothermal vents with biological communities are located near the caldera fault and along the rift zones. Hydrothermal venting was discovered north of the caldera in 1983. Detailed mapping and sampling efforts have identified more than 50 lava flows emplaced since about 410 CE (Clague et al., 2013). Eruptions producing fissure-fed lava flows that buried previously installed seafloor instrumentation were detected seismically and geodetically in 1998 and 2011, and confirmed shortly after each eruption during submersible dives.",

The summit region contains a caldera about 3 x 4 km and exhibits numerous lava cones, the highest of which is about 975 m below the ocean surface. The summit platform also includes two well-defined pit craters, sediment-free glassy lava, and low-temperature hydrothermal venting. An arcuate chain of small cones on the western edge of the summit extends north and south of the pit craters and merges into the crests prominent rift zones. Seismicity indicates a magmatic system distinct from that of KÄ«lauea. During 1996 a new pit crater formed at the summit, and lava flows were erupted. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually build a new island; time estimates for the summit to reach the ocean surface range from roughly 10,000 to 100,000 years.",

About 90% of the surface of the basaltic shield volcano is formed of lava flows less than about 1,100 years old; 70% of the surface is younger than 600 years. The long-term eruption from the East rift zone between 1983 and 2018 produced lava flows covering more than 100 km2, destroyed hundreds of houses, and added new coastline.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Hawaiian Islands, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Two of the youngest large debris avalanches documented in Hawaii traveled nearly 100 km from Mauna Loa; the second of the Alika avalanches was emplaced about 105,000 years ago (Moore et al., 1989). Almost 90% of the surface of the volcano is covered by lavas less than 4,000 years old (Lockwood and Lipman, 1987). Beginning about 1,500 years ago, a series of voluminous overflows from a summit lava lake covered about 25% of the volcano's surface. Over the last 750 years, from shortly after the formation of Moku'aweoweo caldera until the present, an additional 25% of the volcano has been covered with lava flows, mainly from summit and NW rift zone vents.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Hawaiian Islands, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

It's rift zones are less pronounced than on neighboring volcanoes, and the eruption of voluminous, late-stage pyroclastic material has buried much of the early basaltic shield volcano, creating a steeper and more irregular profile. This transition took place about 200,000 to 250,000 years ago, and much of Mauna Kea, whose Hawaiian name means \"White Mountain,\" was constructed during the Pleistocene. Its age and high altitude make it the only Hawaiian volcano with glacial moraines. A road that reaches a cluster of astronomical observatories on the summit also provides access to seasonal tropical skiing.

An older edifice is formed of a lava flow sequence overlain by hydromagmatic deposits and strombolian ejecta. A well-preserved Holocene crater, 150 m wide and 80 m deep, is located NW of the summit and has been the source of the youngest lava flows on the island (Binard et al., 1993). Polynesian legends mention \"large fires,\" and the lack of vegetation on some lava flows suggests that the latest activity occurred within the last 2000 years (Talandier and Custer, 1976). Other recent activity originated from a submarine crater at 2500-2700 m depth on the SE flank.",

The summit, named after volcanologist Gordon Macdonald, consists of a flat plateau about 100 x 150 m wide with an average depth of about 40 m. The summit plateau is capped with spatter cones that form steep-sided pinnacles. Most eruptions have been seismically detected, but in 1987 and 1989 pumice emission was observed from research vessels. Pumice rafts observed in the South Pacific in 1928 and 1936 may also have originated here.",

Hot-vent animal communities that had been documented during November-December 1989 had been buried by fresh basaltic lava flows, and the scorched soft tissues of partially buried biota had not yet attracted bottom scavengers. Fresh black smoker chimneys were draped by new lava flows. This site is south of the Clipperton Fracture Zone at a depth of about 2,500 m, and about 1,000 km SW of Acapulco, MÃ©xico. It coincided with a location where fresh lava flows previously estimated as less than roughly 50 years in age had been found. Later dating of very short half-life radionuclides from dredged samples confirmed the young age of the eruption and indicated that another eruptive event had taken place in late 1991 and early 1992. An eruption in 2005-2006 produced lava flows that entrapped previously emplaced seismometers. The south end of the Lamont Seamount chain is about 10 km NW.",

A large area of hydrothermal vents along the crest of the ridge ENE of the GalÃ¡pagos Islands was discovered in 1977. The location listed here is the position of Clambake vent, which was surrounded by very youthful sediment-free flows of basaltic sheet lava. This position is at the northern limit of the location error circle for a 1972 earthquake swarm and only a few kilometers south of a concurrent fish kill (Macdonald & Mudie, 1974) that may have been associated with extrusion of these young flows. Morphology of the flows suggested that they were less than 5 years old (Chadwick and Embley, 1994). The GalÃ¡pagos Rift at this point consists of a small rift valley 3-4 km wide with walls 200-250 m high. A low axial ridge formed by the youngest sediment-free lava flows rises about 20 m above the valley floor, flanked by older marginal ridges. A 2002 expedition discovered evidence for new lava flows covering markers emplaced in 1990.",

The high reflectivity of the lava flow indicates a very youthful age. Teleseismically recorded earthquakes in 1964, 1965, and 1969, were of an unusual magnitude. A helium megaplume of a volume consistent with the eruption of a lava flow of this volume was detected several years later at a distant location; its movement was consistent with inferred circulation patterns at mid-ocean depths. These observations led Macdonald et al. (1989) to suggest that part or all of this lava field may have been emplaced within the previous 25 years, during one or more eruptions coincident with the earthquakes and onset of the helium plume.",

Cerro Prieto lies in an active continental rift that is transitional between the transform San Andreas fault system to the north and a spreading ridge of the East Pacific Rise in the Gulf of California to the south. The only surficial volcanic feature at Cerro Prieto, which is located near sea level on the Colorado River delta, is a small, 223-m-high compound dacitic lava dome. A 200-m-wide crater is located at the summit of the NE-most dome. The Cerro Prieto dome was roughly estimated from paleomagnetic evidence to have formed during a series of events between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago. Cucupas Indian legends described a monster that covered the land with hot rocks, which grew through the soil and emitted fire tongues, a possible reference to the growth of the volcano.",

The 2,000 km2 field is a prominent feature in this arid, sparsely populated region between the Arizona border and the head of the Gulf of California. An older volcanic period constructed the Santa Clara basaltic-to-trachytic shield volcano. This was followed by the eruption of more than 500 basaltic cinder cones and lava flows that cover the slopes of Santa Clara and the surrounding desert. Among the principal features of the field are two maars: Elegante crater (1.6 km wide) and Cerro Colorado (1 km wide). Legends from the Tohono O'odham people tell of eruptions, though accounts of ash-and-steam eruptions in the 20th century are questionable.\n\nThis volcano is located within the El Pinacate and Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Initial basaltic-andesite and andesitic submarine eruptions producing palagonite tuffs were followed by the effusion of subaerial dacitic lava flows and the formation of dacitic tuff rings. The latest eruptions formed two rhyolitic obsidian domes, the younger in a tuff cone at the center of the island and at the older at the NW tip of the island.

It consists of two overlapping shield volcanoes with eruption products that form a complete alkali basaltic-to-trachytic series; the younger deposits are found on the northern edifice (Batiza, 1977). The northern shield was considered by Medina et al. (1989) to be Holocene. Collapse scarps in the northern third of the island span ~8 km N-S and 3 km inland from the E coast, with a possible caldera rim an additional 1.5 km W. Mitchell (2003) identified a matching submarine embayment in bathymetry to the E and an offshore depositional lobe from debris avalanches. The open collapse area was later largely filled by trachytic domes and basaltic lava flows that retain morphological surface features. At least five small cones are located along the central part of the eastern coastline. The summit of the southern edifice is about 13 km from the southern tip of the island, with steep cliffs on the W coast exposing the stratigraphy of lava flows and pyroclastic units. The surface is covered by lava flows, along with numerous cones and domes, some more than 1 km across.",

There is a circular, 1-km-wide caldera, west of the center of the oval 4-km-long island. Circumferential faults cut the rim of the more than 100-m-deep caldera, which is floored by a solidified lava lake and contains youthful-looking spatter cones. The volcano was constructed during two north-migrating periods of activity that began with submarine eruptions and included formation of a circular tuff-ring complex enclosing the caldera. The sides of a small volcanic horst in the center of the caldera display lava flows overlying a 2-m-thick halite bed, formed when sea water filled the caldera, creating an evaporite basin. Recent lava flows cover most of the flanks, and fumarolic activity has continued into historical time. A submarine cone with a 2-km-wide summit caldera lies about 5 km ESE of the island on the flanks of the edifice.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Rhyolitic lava domes have been constructed along flank rifts oriented to the N, W, and SE, and silicic lava flows from summit and flank vents have reached the coast and created an extremely irregular shoreline. Late-stage basaltic eruptions produced cones and flows near the coast. Only minor explosive activity, some of which is of uncertain validity, has occurred from flank vents in historical time dating back to the 19th century. In 1951 a brief phreatic eruption ejected blocks, and the gas column reached 1200 m altitude. A submarine eruption occurred during 1993-94 from a vent 3 km W of the island during which large scoriaceous blocks up to 5 m in size floated to the surface without associated explosive activity.",

Most volcanism here is confined to two NNW-SSE-trending grabens cutting Cretaceous ash-flow tuffs. The youngest eruption was a basaltic-andesite lava flow at VolcÃ¡n MalpaÃ­s, north of Mascota; the lack of soil development and sparse vegetation suggest that it may be only a few thousand years old (Carmichael et al., 1996). The field is noted for its unusual diversity of volcanic rocks, and contains Earth's youngest known minettes (lamprophyres).",

A group of late-Pleistocene cinder cones is located on the floor of the Colima graben west and east of the complex. VolcÃ¡n de Colima (also known as VolcÃ¡n Fuego) is a youthful stratovolcano constructed within a 5-km-wide scarp, breached to the south, that has been the source of large debris avalanches. Major slope failures have occurred repeatedly from both the Nevado and Colima cones, producing thick debris-avalanche deposits on three sides of the complex. Frequent recorded eruptions date back to the 16th century. Occasional major explosive eruptions have destroyed the summit (most recently in 1913) and left a deep, steep-sided crater that was slowly refilled and then overtopped by lava dome growth.",

The youngest dated activity at the complex produced La Dieta airfall deposit about 31,000 years ago, and persistent local seismicity continues at ZitÃ¡cuaro. The Valle de Bravo area to the south contains dominantly andesitic lava domes and flows, many of which were erupted along regional faults. The youngest flows were erupted at the bottom of a fault-controlled canyon; the most recent of these, west of the Valle de Bravo lake, has been Ar-Ar dated at about 5,200 Â± 2,300 years, and morphology suggests a Holocene age for other cones.",

The most prominent feature is a horseshoe-shaped escarpment open to the NE that formed as a result of gravitational failure of the summit during the early Holocene. The resulting debris-avalanche deposit covers an 80 km2 area to the NE. Lava dome emplacement accompanied by pyroclastic flows and surges subsequently filled much of the avalanche scarp. The latest known eruption occurred about 700 years ago and produced block-and-ash flows and pyroclastic surges.",

The best-known eruption occurred about 1,670 radiocarbon years ago (400 CE) from the Xitle scoria cone, NE of the VolcÃ¡n Ajusco lava dome complex, which forms the highest peak of the Sierra Chichinautzin. The Xitle eruption produced a massive basaltic tube-fed lava flow that covered agricultural lands as well as pyramids and other structures of Cuicuilco and adjacent prehispanic urban centers. The southern part of Mexico City and the National University of MÃ©xico lie atop the distal end of the 13-km-long lava flow.",

The youngest vents are located at the summit and a depression at 5,100 m along the summit ridge midway between El Pecho and Los Pies (White, 1986). Nixon (1989) considered all summit lavas to be Pleistocene, but noted a postglacial dacitic vent on the south flank of IztaccÃ­huatl, north of the saddle between it and PopocatÃ©petl.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Las Volcanes, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The generally symmetrical volcano is modified by the sharp-peaked Ventorrillo on the NW, a remnant of an earlier volcano. At least three previous major cones were destroyed by gravitational failure during the Pleistocene, producing massive debris-avalanche deposits covering broad areas to the south. The modern volcano was constructed south of the late-Pleistocene to Holocene El Fraile cone. Three major Plinian eruptions, the most recent of which took place about 800 CE, have occurred since the mid-Holocene, accompanied by pyroclastic flows and voluminous lahars that swept basins below the volcano. Frequent historical eruptions, first recorded in Aztec codices, have occurred since Pre-Columbian time.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Las Volcanes, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The emplacement of post-caldera lava domes and eruption of the 40 km3 Faby Tuff about 240,000 years BP was followed by eruption of the Zaragoza Tuff about 100,000 years BP and formation of the nested 10-km-wide Los Potreros caldera. A third and much smaller caldera (El Xalapazco) was formed about 40,000-20,000 years BP. The most recent eruptions include the production of extensive morphologically youthful basaltic lava flows that are undated, but are younger than a 20,000 BP rhyolitic lava flow and could be in part of early Holocene age. A major explosive eruption about 6400 years ago produced the bimodal plinian Cuilcuiltic Member tephra.

Numerous monogenetic cinder cones, likely related to regional volcanism, were erupted through the flanks. A cluster of youthful basaltic cinder cones is located on the NE flank, and young lava flows have traveled eastward to beyond the major city of Xalapa (Jalapa), the capital of the state of Veracruz.

Construction of the initial Torrecillas and EspolÃ³n de Oro volcanoes was contemporaneous with growth of Sierra Negra volcano on the SW flank and was followed by edifice collapses that produced voluminous debris avalanches and lahars. The modern volcano was constructed during the late Pleistocene and Holocene of viscous andesitic and dacitic lavas, forming the current steep-sided cone. Repetitive explosive eruptions beginning during the early Holocene accompanied lava dome growth and lava effusion. Historical eruptions have consisted of moderate explosive activity and the effusion of dacitic lava flows. The latest eruption occurred during the 19th century.",

The largest dome, the former summit of the volcano, was constructed within a 1.6 x 2 km summit crater created about 220,000 years ago. Two other large craters are located on the SW and SE flanks; a lava dome fills the SW crater, and an older dome is located on the NW flank. More than ten large explosive eruptions have occurred since the mid-Holocene. The powerful 1982 explosive eruptions of high-sulfur, anhydrite-bearing magma destroyed the summit lava dome and were accompanied by pyroclastic flows and surges that devastated an area extending about 8 km around the volcano. The eruptions created a new 1-km-wide, 300-m-deep crater that now contains an acidic crater lake.",

The volcano rises 1800 m above deeply dissected plutonic and metamorphic terrain. Three large calderas breached to the south, and the elongated summit region is dominated by a series of lava domes intruded along a NE-SW trend. Volcanism has migrated to the SW, and a small adventive lava dome is located in the crater of the youngest volcano, San Antonio, on the upper SW flank. Viscous lava flow complexes are found on the north and south flanks, and lobate lahar deposits fill many valleys. Radial drainages on the Guatemalan side are deflected by surrounding mountains into the Pacific coastal plain on the SW side of the volcano. Historical activity has been restricted to mild phreatic eruptions, but more powerful explosive activity, including the production of pyroclastic flows, has occurred as recently as about 1950 years ago.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcan Tacana, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

A lava flow from the ~4200-m-high NW summit traveled down a deep valley on the NW flank. The andesitic-dacitic volcano was constructed over the NW end of a large arcuate SW-facing escarpment of uncertain origin. Tajumulco has had several unconfirmed reports of historical eruptions. Sapper (1917) considered it to have erupted during historical time, but without accurate dates. The volcano was reported to eject many rocks, destroying houses on 24 October 1765, but this may have been a rock avalanche. Juarros reported some eruptions before 1808, and there are unlikely reports of eruptions in 1821 (or 1822), 1863, and 1893 (Incer 1988, unpublished manuscript).",

The renowned Plinian eruption of 1902 that devastated much of SW Guatemala followed a long repose period after construction of the large basaltic-andesite stratovolcano. The massive dacitic Santiaguito lava-dome complex has been growing at the base of the 1902 crater since 1922. Compound dome growth at Santiaguito has occurred episodically from four vents, with activity progressing E towards the most recent, Caliente. Dome growth has been accompanied by almost continuous minor explosions, with periodic lava extrusion, larger explosions, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.",

The youngest and only historically active dome complex is Cerro Quemado (whose name means Burned Peak), located immediately south of Guatemala's second largest city, Quezaltenango. About 1200 radiocarbon years ago, part of the andesitic-to-dacitic Cerro Quemado dome collapsed, producing a debris avalanche and an associated lateral explosion that swept across the valley to the west as far as the flanks of Siete Orejas volcano. The latest eruption in 1818 produced a blocky 2.5-km-long lava flow. Hot springs are located on the northern and eastern flanks of Cerro Quemado, and the ZunÃ­l geothermal field, the site of a geothermal exploration project, lies on the SE flank of Cerro Quemado.",

An ancestral Acatenango volcano collapsed to the south sometime prior to 43,000 years ago, forming La Democracia debris-avalanche deposit, which covers a wide area of the Pacific coastal plain. Construction of Yepocapa, the northern summit of Acatenango, was completed about 20,000 years ago, after which growth of the southern and highest cone, Pico Central (also known as Pico Mayor), began. The first well-documented eruptions took place from 1924 to 1927, although earlier historical eruptions may have occurred. Francisco Vasquez, writing in 1690, noted that in 1661 a volcano that lay aside of Fuego \"opened a smoking mouth and still gives off smoke from another three, but without noise.\"",

Construction of Meseta dates back to about 230,000 years and continued until the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. Collapse of Meseta may have produced the massive Escuintla debris-avalanche deposit, which extends about 50 km onto the Pacific coastal plain. Growth of the modern Fuego volcano followed, continuing the southward migration of volcanism that began at the mostly andesitic Acatenango. Eruptions at Fuego have become more mafic with time, and most historical activity has produced basaltic rocks. Frequent vigorous historical eruptions have been recorded since the onset of the Spanish era in 1524, and have produced major ashfalls, along with occasional pyroclastic flows and lava flows.",

A cluster of dacitic lava domes occupies the southern caldera floor. The post-caldera Pacaya massif includes the ancestral Pacaya Viejo and Cerro Grande stratovolcanoes and the currently active Mackenney stratovolcano. Collapse of Pacaya Viejo between 600 and 1500 years ago produced a debris-avalanche deposit that extends 25 km onto the Pacific coastal plain and left an arcuate somma rim inside which the modern Pacaya volcano (Mackenney cone) grew. A subsidiary crater, Cerro Chino, was constructed on the NW somma rim and was last active in the 19th century. During the past several decades, activity has consisted of frequent strombolian eruptions with intermittent lava flow extrusion that has partially filled in the caldera moat and armored the flanks of Mackenney cone, punctuated by occasional larger explosive eruptions that partially destroy the summit of the growing young stratovolcano.",

Steep walls 60-250 m high rise above the flat caldera floor. One of the latest basaltic lava emissions flowed through a low notch in the eastern caldera rim.

Obsidian from Ixtepeque has shown up at archaeological sites across Central America. Flat-lying pumice beds produced by explosive eruptions preceding lava effusion are found locally around the volcano. Other obsidian flows originated from lava domes NE of Ixtepeque. These rhyolitic vents are interspersed with basaltic cinder cones and lava flows. Laguna de Obrajuelo is a complex cone cut by a large crater more than a km in diameter. Initial basaltic eruptions were followed by the extrusion of obsidian flows and the eruption of rhyolitic pumice that were considered by Williams et al. (1964) to be only a few thousand years old.",

These were followed by the eruption of widespread lava flows NW of Chiquimula town that covered about 12 km2. The most recent eruptions produced basaltic cinder cones and lava flows near the northern edge of Chiquimula town. The cinder cones were constructed along a N-S-trending fracture, with Cerro Grande, the largest, at the northern end and Cerro Chiquito, the youngest, at the southern end. Lava flows from Cerro Chiquito are so fresh in appearance and sparsely vegetated that they were considered by Williams et al. (1964) to be possibly less than 1,000 years old.",

The caldera was formed during a series of major rhyolitic explosive eruptions between ~72,000 and 51,000 years ago. Post-caldera eruptions included the formation of basaltic cinder cones and lava flows near the western margin of the caldera and the extrusion of a half-dozen rhyodacitic lava domes along a NE-SW line near the caldera lake margins. The highest of the domes forms the wooded island of Isla de Cabra, or Cerro Grande. The age of the domes is not known precisely, but the youngest dome, Cerro Pacho, was estimated to have formed less than 10,000 years ago.

It contained a crater lake prior to an eruption during 1917 that formed a small cinder cone on the crater floor; a major N-flank lava flow also erupted in this year. Three fracture zones that extend beyond the base of the volcano have been the locus for numerous flank eruptions, including two that formed maars on the WNW and SE sides. Most of the four historical eruptions recorded since the 16th century have originated from flank vents, including two in the 17th century from the NW-flank cone of El PlayÃ³n, during which explosions and a lava flow damaged inhabited areas.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Joya de Ceren Archaeological site, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Four major dacitic-rhyolitic explosive eruptions during the late Pleistocene and Holocene produced pyroclastic-flow and pyroclastic-fall deposits that cover much of El Salvador. The latest collapse resulted from the massive 5th century CE Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption, which produced widespread pyroclastic flows and devastated early Mayan cities. Post-caldera eruptions formed a series of glassy dacitic and andesitic lava domes within the lake and near its shore. The Islas Quemadas, a group of low islets in the center of the lake that mark the summit of a largely submerged lava dome, were formed during an eruption in 1879-80.",

Volcanism has continued into the Holocene, but the latest lava flows are covered by deposits from the major ca. 260 CE eruption from neighboring Ilopango.

The longest flow traveled N to the village of RÃ­o Lindo, where a waterfall cascades over the terminus of the flow. A few Quaternary lava flows occur in the Sulu graben along the Carretara del Norte N of Lake Yojoa. The rocks range from tholeiitic basalts to trachybasalts, trachyandesites, and trachytes. Two trachyandesitic tephra beds attributed to local eruptions and sampled by Mehringer et al.

Young lava flows extend down the NW flank into the 4-km-wide Monte GalÃ¡n caldera. The youthful cone of Momotombito forms an island offshore in Lake Managua. Momotombo has a long record of Strombolian eruptions, punctuated by occasional stronger explosive activity. The latest eruption, in 1905, produced a lava flow that traveled from the summit to the lower NE base. A small black plume was seen above the crater after a 10 April 1996 earthquake, but later observations noted no significant changes in the crater.

It lies within the massive Pleistocene Las Sierras caldera and is itself a broad, 6 x 11 km basaltic caldera with steep-sided walls up to 300 m high. The caldera is filled on its NW end by more than a dozen vents that erupted along a circular, 4-km-diameter fracture system. The NindirÃ­ and Masaya cones, the source of observed eruptions, were constructed at the southern end of the fracture system and contain multiple summit craters, including the currently active Santiago crater. A major basaltic Plinian tephra erupted from Masaya about 6,500 years ago. Recent lava flows cover much of the caldera floor and there is a lake at the far eastern end. A lava flow from the 1670 eruption overtopped the north caldera rim. Periods of long-term vigorous gas emission at roughly quarter-century intervals have caused health hazards and crop damage.",

Two small, well-preserved cinder cones are located on the lower N flank. The only reported activity was in 1570, when a debris avalanche destroyed a village on the south side of the volcano.

A steep-walled summit crater is 250 m deep and has a higher western rim. N-S-trending fractures on the flanks have produced chains of spatter cones, cinder cones, lava domes, and maars located on the NW, NE, SE, and southern sides extending in some cases down to Lake Nicaragua. ConcepciÃ³n was constructed above a basement of lake sediments, and the modern cone grew above a largely buried caldera, a small remnant of which forms a break in slope about halfway up the N flank. Frequent explosive eruptions during the past half century have increased the height of the summit significantly above that shown on current topographic maps and have kept the upper part of the volcano unvegetated.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Ometepe, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

Five coalescing andesitic-dacitic lava domes are located in the center of the caldera, and additional domes are present on the outer flanks. Las Lajas was considered to be of Holocene age on the basis of youthful morphology (McBirney and Williams, 1965), however Plank et al. (2002) obtained three radiometric dates of Miocene age, and the main edifice may be older than previously thought. Van Wyk de Vries (1999, pers. comm.) earlier noted that Las Lajas itself was of probable Pleistocene age, but that youthful cinder cones on the flanks are similar to those of the Nejapa alignment and may be of Holocene age.",

Historical eruptions were reported from OrosÃ­ in 1844 and 1849, but even at the time of the first volcanological observations at the end of the 19th century, OrosÃ­ was overgrown with large trees, and the eruptions may actually have been from neighboring RincÃ³n de la Vieja.

Sometimes known as the \"Colossus of Guanacaste,\" it has an estimated volume of 130 km3 and contains at least nine major eruptive centers. Activity has migrated to the SE, where the youngest-looking craters are located. The twin cone of Santa MarÃ­a volcano, the highest peak of the complex, is located at the eastern end of a smaller, 5-km-wide caldera and has a 500-m-wide crater. A Plinian eruption producing the 0.25 km3 RÃ­o Blanca tephra about 3,500 years ago was the last major magmatic eruption. All subsequent eruptions, including numerous historical eruptions possibly dating back to the 16th century, have been from the prominent active crater containing a 500-m-wide acid lake located ENE of Von Seebach crater.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Area de ConservaciÃ³n Guanacaste, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Growth of post-caldera volcanoes in the eastern part of the caldera that overtopped much of the eastern and southern caldera rims was interrupted by edifice collapse which produced a major debris avalanche to the SW. Morphologically youthful lava flows cover the W and SW flanks of the post-caldera Miravalles complex, which rises above the town of Guayabo on the flat western caldera floor. A small steam explosion on the SW flank was reported in 1946. High heat flow remains, and it is the site of a large developed geothermal field.",

The earliest known eruptions of Arenal took place about 7000 years ago, and it was active concurrently with Cerro Chato until the activity of Chato ended about 3500 years ago. Growth of Arenal has been characterized by periodic major explosive eruptions at several-hundred-year intervals and periods of lava effusion that armor the cone. An eruptive period that began with a major explosive eruption in 1968 ended in December 2010; continuous explosive activity accompanied by slow lava effusion and the occasional emission of pyroclastic flows characterized the eruption from vents at the summit and on the upper western flank.",

The more prominent geothermally heated northern lake, Laguna Caliente, is one of the world's most acidic natural lakes, with a pH of near zero. It has been the site of frequent phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions since an eruption was reported in 1828. Eruptions often include geyser-like ejections of crater-lake water.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Cordillera Volcanica Central, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The voluminous andesitic-to-dacitic TiribÃ­ Tuff, exposed in the Central Valley, was erupted about 322,000 years ago. The summit area is dominated by a 2 x 3 km crater open to the ESE. One of the cones on the upper N flank contains a crater lake. Cones are also found on the S flanks, along with lava flows. The Los Angeles flow, one of the most recent, descends nearly to the city of Heredia. A large Plinian eruption occurred during the early Holocene. Eruptions were reported in 1760 or 1766, 1776? (also a mudflow), and 1867, but later visits to the summit did not provide evidence for recent activity.",

No lava effusion is known since the eruption of the Cervantes lava flows from S-flank vents about 14,000 years ago, and all known Holocene eruptions have been explosive. The focus of eruptions at the summit crater complex has migrated to the W towards the main crater, which contains a small lake. The first well-documented eruption occurred in 1723, and frequent explosive eruptions have occurred since. Ashfall from the last major eruption during 1963-65 caused significant disruption to San JosÃ© and surrounding areas.

The forested volcano (also referred to as VolcÃ¡n de Chiriqui) is the highest peak in PanamÃ¡, and the summit hosts many communication towers. A large 6-km-wide summit caldera breached to the west was formed by a large volcanic landslide, which created a massive debris-avalanche deposit about 9,000 years ago that extends onto the Pacific coastal plain, largely overlying a late-Pleistocene avalanche deposit. Post-collapse eruptions have constructed lava domes inside the caldera that have grown to a height exceeding that of the caldera rim. A strong explosive eruption at about 700 CE ended human occupation at the Cerro Punta archaeological site NW of the volcano. Montessus de Ballore (1884) reported a strong eruption in the mid-16th century; Sapper (1917) considered this report to be uncertain, but radiocarbon dates subsequently implied tephra deposits younger than about 500 years. VolcÃ¡n BarÃº is the youngest major volcano in PanamÃ¡, and geothermal exploration projects have been undertaken to determine its energy potential.\n\nThis volcano is located within the La Amistad, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The caldera has steep, 200-300 m high walls overlooking a flat floor underlain by deposits of a former caldera lake and currently occupied by the town of El Valle. Cerro Pajita, Cerro Gaital, and Cerro Caracoral form a dacitic lava dome complex that was constructed along an E-W lineament within the caldera and forms the high point of the volcano. Major phreatomagmatic plinian eruptions produced when magma interacted with caldera-lake water as recently as about 34,600 years ago generated pyroclastic flows that reached the Pacific coast, 25 km S. Phreatic eruptions have occurred since then (the most recent dated eruption took place about 13,000 years ago), and activity may have continued into the Holocene (IRHE, 1987).

The modern cone consists of a broad cluster of lava domes built within the caldera of an older edifice. The 1-km-wide, 240-m-deep Arenas crater occupies the summit. The prominent La Olleta pyroclastic cone located on the SW flank may also have been active in historical time. Steep headwalls of massive landslides cut the flanks. Melting of its summit icecap during historical eruptions, which date back to the 16th century, has resulted in devastating lahars, including one in 1985 that was South America's deadliest eruption.",

The dominantly andesitic complex has been active for more than 1 million years, and two major caldera collapse eruptions took place during the late Pleistocene. Long-term extensive hydrothermal alteration has contributed to large-scale edifice collapse on at least three occasions, producing debris avalanches that swept to the west and left a large open caldera inside which the modern cone has been constructed. Major explosive eruptions since the mid-Holocene have produced widespread tephra deposits and pyroclastic flows that swept all but the southern flanks. A central cone slightly lower than the caldera rim has been the site of numerous small-to-moderate eruptions since the time of the Spanish conquistadors.",

The andesitic-to-rhyolitic Fuya Fuya volcano was constructed contemporaneously immediately to the west of Mojanda and produced two major rhyolitic plinian explosive eruptions, possibly associated with caldera formation. Fuya Fuya underwent edifice collapse less than 165,000 years ago, leaving a large horseshoe-shaped caldera open to the west. Subsequently, a new composite cone and dacitic lava domes were extruded inside the caldera. The youngest domes are unglaciated and of possible Holocene age.",

Deep valleys scoured by lahars radiate from the summit of the andesitic volcano, and large andesitic lava flows extend to its base. The modern edifice has been constructed since a major collapse sometime prior to about 5,000 years ago. Pyroclastic flows (often confused in historical accounts with lava flows) have accompanied many explosive eruptions, and lahars have frequently devastated adjacent valleys. Strong eruptions took place in 1744, 1768, and 1877. Pyroclastic flows descended all sides of the volcano in 1877, and lahars traveled more than 100 km into the Pacific Ocean and western Amazon basin. Smaller eruptions have been frequent since that time.",

Subsequent mainly been andesitic activity constructed three edifices along an E-W line, the youngest and westernmost of which forms the current summit.

The steep-sided, glacier-covered, dominantly andesitic volcano grew within the open calderas of two previous edifices which were destroyed by collapse to the east, producing large debris avalanches that reached the Amazonian lowlands. The modern edifice dates back to at least 14,000 years ago. It towers above the tropical jungle on the east side; on the other sides flat plains of ash have been eroded by heavy rains into steep-walled canyons up to 600 m deep. The earliest report of an eruption was in 1628. Almost continuous eruptions were reported from 1728 until 1916, and again from 1934 to the present. The almost constant activity has caused frequent changes to the morphology of the summit crater complex.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Sangay National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The volcano displays the classic \"overturned soup bowl\" profile of GalÃ¡pagos shield volcanoes. Its caldera is elongated in a NW-SE direction and formed during several episodes of collapse. Circumferential fissures surround the caldera and were instrumental in growth of the volcano. Reporting has been poor in this uninhabited western end of the archipelago, and even a 1981 eruption was not witnessed at the time. In 1968 the caldera floor dropped 350 m following a major explosive eruption. Subsequent eruptions, mostly from vents located on or near the caldera boundary faults, have produced lava flows inside the caldera as well as those in 1995 that reached the coast from a SW-flank vent. Collapse of a nearly 1 km3 section of the east caldera wall during an eruption in 1988 produced a debris-avalanche deposit that covered much of the caldera floor and absorbed the caldera lake.\n\nThis volcano is located within the ArchipiÃ©lago de ColÃ³n (GalÃ¡pagos), a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

It is the only Galapagos volcano known to have erupted rhyolite as well as basalt, producing about 1 km3 of late-Pleistocene rhyolitic tephra and lava flows from several vents late in its history. Recent faulting has produced a moat around part of the 7-8 km caldera floor, which is elongated N-S and appears to be migrating to the south. Fewer circumferential fissures occur on Alcedo than on other western GalÃ¡pagos volcanoes. An eruption attributed to Alcedo in 1954 (Richards, 1957) is more likely to have been from neighboring Sierra Negra (Simkin 1980, pers. comm.). Photo-geologic mapping by K.A. Howard (pers. comm.) revealed only one flow on 30 October 1960 photographs that does not appear on 30 May 1946 photos. That is near Cartago Bay, low on the SE flank, rather than the 610-m, NE-flank elevation listed for the 1954 eruption. An active hydrothermal system is located within the caldera.\n\nThis volcano is located within the ArchipiÃ©lago de ColÃ³n (GalÃ¡pagos), a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The shield volcano is the second highest of the archipelago. A conspicuous bench occupies the SW and west sides of the caldera, which formed during several episodes of collapse. Youthful lava flows cover much of the caldera floor, which has also contained ephemeral lakes. A prominent tuff cone located at the ENE side of the caldera is evidence of episodic hydrovolcanism. Numerous spatter cones dot the western flanks. Fresh-looking lava flows, many erupted from circumferential fissures, descend the NE and NW flanks. Historical eruptions date back only to 1932, but Cerro Azul has been one of the most active GalÃ¡pagos volcanoes since that time. Solfataric activity continues within the caldera.\n\nThis volcano is located within the ArchipiÃ©lago de ColÃ³n (GalÃ¡pagos), a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

At least 20 tephra-fall deposits and numerous pyroclastic-flow deposits have been documented during the past 50,000 years, including a pyroclastic flow that traveled 12 km to the south about 2000 years ago. The most recent activity has been dominantly pyroclastic, and strong winds have formed a parabolic dune field of volcanic ash extending up to 20 km downwind. An eruption in the 15th century affected nearby Inca inhabitants. Some reports of historical eruptions may represent increased fumarolic activity.",

It is the northernmost of three young volcanoes located along a regional structural lineament about 50 km behind the main volcanic front. The growth and destruction of Ubinas I was followed by construction of Ubinas II beginning in the mid-Pleistocene. The upper slopes of the andesitic-to-rhyolitic Ubinas II stratovolcano are composed primarily of andesitic and trachyandesitic lava flows and steepen to nearly 45 degrees. The steep-walled, 150-m-deep summit caldera contains an ash cone with a 500-m-wide funnel-shaped vent that is 200 m deep. Debris-avalanche deposits from the collapse of the SE flank about 3,700 years ago extend 10 km from the volcano. Widespread Plinian pumice-fall deposits include one of Holocene age about 1,000 years ago. Holocene lava flows are visible on the flanks, but historical activity, documented since the 16th century, has consisted of intermittent minor-to-moderate explosive eruptions.",

It overlies Pleistocene ignimbrite deposits and trends roughly E-W, with activity migrating generally to the SW during four principal periods of activity dating back at least 1.5 million years. At least three major edifice collapse events have produced debris-avalanche deposits, the youngest of which underlies Putre. Studies have shown that explosive activity with dome growth and associated block-and-ash flows and lahars continued into the late Holocene. The youngest volcanic stage, beginning about 9000 years ago, produced the summit lava dome of the Putre Unit at the E and S ends of the complex.

Holocene eruptive activity has subsequently reconstructed the stratovolcano, which contains a pristine, 300-m-wide summit crater and youthful lava flows on the W flanks.

Both domes differ morphologically from many other flat-topped silicic Andean volcanic domes and have conical profiles. The Cerro ChascÃ³n de Purico dacitic dome was formed by a series of viscous lava flows and has a well-preserved summit crater and lava flows that show no evidence of glacial modification. The Cerro Aspero appears to be a single Pelean-type dome.

Frequent small-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded since the mid-19th century, along with periodic larger eruptions that produced ashfall hundreds of kilometers away.

Although no historical eruptions have been recorded, the youthful morphology of deposits suggests activity during historical time.

A major rhyodacitic explosive eruption about 1000-1500 years ago produced pumiceous pyroclastic flows. The most recent eruptive activity appears to have originated along a NNE-trending rift along the summit complex. It involved formation of a thick, viscous lava flow and at least a dozen small cones, lava domes, and explosion craters.

Many youthful-looking flank lava flows were erupted from the well-preserved summit crater. Schwab and Lippolt (1976) obtained a Potassium-Argon date of 0.1 million years ago on what they believed to be the youngest Tuzgle lava. However, de Silva and Francis (1991) and GonzÃ¡lez-FerrÃ¡n (1995) considered the latest activity to be of Holocene age, and Coira and Kay (1993, Fig. 2B) placed the youngest flow at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. Activity began with the eruption of a rhyodacitic ignimbrite, followed by construction of a lava dome complex on the rim of an existing caldera. Andesitic lava flows covered much of the dome complex and later partially filled the crater. Several edifice-collapse events occurred during the evolution of the volcano. The youngest flows were erupted on the SE and SW flanks.",

Ar-Ar age dates for 22 samples taken from throughout the main part of the field ranged from 7.3 to less than 0.1 Ma (Risse et al., 2008); older age dates primarily from the Antofalla field area had been in the 0.07-6.64 Ma range. However, the area about 7 km S of the town of Antofagasta de la Sierra with the two Alumbrera cinder cones and lava flows with the most pristine appearance, and considered to be perhaps only a few thousand years old, has not been sampled and dated in any known study.

Activity began in the Pleistocene with construction of the basaltic-andesite to dacitic VolcÃ¡n Azufre, followed by formation of basaltic and basaltic-andesite VolcÃ¡n PlanchÃ³n, 6 km to the north. About 11,500 years ago, much of Azufre and part of PlanchÃ³n collapsed, forming the massive RÃ­o Teno debris avalanche, which traveled 95 km to reach Chile's Central Valley. Subsequently, VolcÃ¡n PlanchÃ³n II was formed. The youngest volcano, andesitic and basaltic-andesite VolcÃ¡n Peteroa, consists of scattered vents between Azufre and PlanchÃ³n. Peteroa has been active into historical time and contains a small steaming crater lake. Historical eruptions from the complex have been dominantly explosive, although lava flows were erupted in 1837 and 1937.",

The Pleistocene Pampas Onduladas pahoehoe lava flow traveled 181 km, Earth's longest known Quaternary lava flow. Post-caldera basaltic eruptions produced more than 300 eruptive centers, mostly along E-W fissures that extend across the entire edifice. Fluid lava flows from a concentration of vents on the W flank known as Los Volcanes traveled more than 10 km. Other vent clusters of the 5,200 km2 volcanic field are found on the lower NE and S flanks, and a lava flow from VolcÃ¡n Santa MarÃ­a on the NW flank traveled 15 km NE. At least 30 trachyandesitic lava domes and basaltic lava flows were erupted contemporaneously with the basaltic fissure eruptions. The Puente and Chapua volcanic units east of the main shield and south of the Ondulas flow are considered part of the field. Oral traditions note that indigenous tribes were present at the time of the latest eruption.",

VolcÃ¡n Viejo (VolcÃ¡n ChillÃ¡n), which was the main active vent during the 17th-19th centuries, occupies the SE end. The VolcÃ¡n Nuevo lava-dome complex formed during 1906-1945 on the NW flank of Viejo. The VolcÃ¡n Arrau dome complex was then constructed on the SE side of VolcÃ¡n Nuevo between 1973 and 1986, and eventually exceeded its height.

Holocene vents are also located in the Cerro Michico area on the lower NE flank. Eruptions were reported in the mid-18th century and in 1822. Von Wolff (1929) attributed purported eruptions of Pomahuida in 1820, 1823, 1827, and 1828 as being from Tromen, but these are not confirmed.",

Construction of the Antuco I volcano was followed by edifice failure at the beginning of the Holocene that produced a large debris avalanche which traveled down the RÃ­o Laja to the west and left a large 5-km-wide caldera breached to the west. The steep-sided modern basaltic-to-andesitic cone has grown 1,000 m since then; flank fissures and cones have also been active. Moderate explosive eruptions were recorded in the 18th and 19th centuries from both summit and flank vents, and lava flows have traveled into the RÃ­o Laja drainage.",

The ice-capped, basaltic-andesite volcano contains well-preserved cones and lava flows, which have traveled up to 14 km. Small craters 100-500 m in diameter are primarily found along a fissure extending down the SW flank. Intense solfataric activity occurs at the southern portion of the summit; in 1966 and 1978, red glow was observed in fumarolic areas (Moreno 1985, pers. comm.). Periods of intense fumarolic activity have dominated; few historical eruptions are known. An explosive eruption was reported in 1751, there were uncertain accounts of eruptions in 1864 and 1937, and a small phreatic ash emission was noted in 1980.",

Reports of eruptions in 1876 and on 7 January 1933 are not confirmed; the latter date probably refers to an eruption of Lonquimay or Llaima (Petit-Breuilh 1994, pers. comm.). Polanco et al. (2000) stated that explosive activity consisted of three VEI 3-4 eruptions between 8050 and 6590 BP. The Pemehue volcanic trend on the NW flank was noted by Naranjo (pers. comm. 2010) in Melosh et al. (2012) as having post-glacial lava flows dated at less than 6,000 years old. Only fumarolic activity has occurred from this basaltic-andesitic volcano during historical time.

Constructed within a large 7 x 10 km caldera, this glacier-covered volcano contains a 3.5-km-wide caldera and a truncated central cone. Work by Simmons et al. (2020) identified sixteen Holocene vents and their associated lavas around the lower flanks; compositions were dominantly trachyte, with one basaltic andesite eruption and two of trachyandesite. While each vent could represent a distinct eruption, and no absolute dates are available, Simmons et al. (2020) suggested that there had been about 10 eruptive periods associated with the vents, and that evidence of Holocene activity that had constructed the main cone had been removed by ice advances and retreats during the Little Ice Age. Four Holocene pumice lapilli deposits were identified by Fontijn et al. (2016) as originating from QuetrupillÃ¡n, with compositions ranging from rhyolite to dacite. Other nearby volcanic features include a basaltic scoria cone 12 km NE, a rhyolitic lava dome on the S flank of the caldera, and both scoria cones and basaltic-andesite lava flows about 15 km S. An eruption was reported in 1872 (Petit-Breuilh, pers. comm. 2004; Petit-Breuilh SepÃºlveda, 2004), but Simmons et al. (2020) noted that there was no corroboration from multiple independent sources for such an event.",

The beautifully symmetrical, 3776-m-high LanÃ­n rises 2500 m above its base; shoulder areas on the upper flanks hint at a buried caldera. The volcano was formed in four eruptive stages dating back to the early Pleistocene or late Pliocene. The last two stages occurred during the late-Pleistocene and Holocene. A small lava dome at the summit fed blocky lava flows to the north about 2200 years ago. LanÃ­n was reported active after an earthquake in 1906, but Sapper (1917) stated that newspaper accounts are strongly disputed, and no historical eruptions are known. A postglacial tuff ring (VolcÃ¡n Arenal) is located below the SW flank in Argentina. A younger lava flow from LanÃ­n covers deposits of VolcÃ¡n Arenal and extends south into Lago PaimÃºn.",

A Holocene compound cinder cone with three nested craters up to 400 m in diameter that occupied a valley NE of Cerro HuanquihuÃ© and a tuff cone constructed within glacial Lake Epulafquen lies at the northern end of the chain. Growth of this Holocene tuff cone, La Angostura (\"The Narrowing\"), created a peninsula that formed a narrow channel connecting Lake Epulafquen and Lake Huechulafquen. A very recent lava flow from the base of the AchÃ­n-Niellu cinder cone (also known as Cerro Escorial) traveled north into glacial Lago Epulafquen, forming a prominent lava delta. The Escorial lava flow is an extremely youthful flow that diverted local drainages and formed new lakes. A radiocarbon date of about 200 years before present was obtained from this flow, and local residents recount oral histories of the eruption, which was observed by their grandparents.",

The edifice is elongated in a SW-NE direction and is capped by a 400-500 m wide summit crater. The complex evolution included collapse of an intermediate edifice during the late Pleistocene that produced a 3-km3 debris avalanche that reached the lake. It has erupted frequently during the Holocene, and one of the largest historical eruptions in southern Chile took place from Calbuco in 1893-1894 that concluded with lava dome emplacement. Subsequent eruptions have enlarged the lava-dome complex in the summit crater.",

The compound caldera is drained through a breach on its NW rim, which has been the source of mudflows down the RÃ­o de Los Huemeles. Two cinder cones occur N of the volcano and others occupy the SW and SE flanks. This volcano has been the source of several major Holocene explosive eruptions. An eruption about 6,700 years ago was one of the largest known in the southern Andes during the Holocene; another eruption about 3,600 years ago also produced more than 10 km3 of tephra. An eruption in 1991 formed a new 800-m-wide crater in the SW portion of the caldera.",

The summit of the volcano, known as Mount Scenery (or The Mountain), is a Holocene lava dome that overtops a major collapse scarp that formed about 100,000 years ago. Flank domes were constructed on the SW, SE, east, and NE sides of the island near the coast. A large andesitic lava flow entered the sea on the NE flank, forming the Flat Point Peninsula, the only site level enough on which to locate the island's airport. The village of The Bottom overlies pyroclastic-surge deposits that contain European pottery fragments and were radiocarbon dated at 280 Â± 80 years before present. The village was settled in 1640 on grassy meadows on the volcano's flanks reflecting initial vegetation recovery following destruction of tropical rainforests by pyroclastic flows and surges. Lava dome growth may also have occurred during this SW-flank eruption.",

The interaction of rhyolitic magma with sea water produced pyroclastic-surge deposits, rich in limestone fragments, that joined the two islands and blanket the entire slopes of the volcano. The surges also swept across the older island and incorporated carbonized plant remains, shell fragments, and remains of fossil hermit crabs. A likely cryptodome tilted up limestones at Sugarloaf on the southern coast. A steep-sided crater, 760 m wide and more than 300 m deep, caps The Quill; a notch on the western crater rim has directed the youngest pyroclastic flows towards the island's capital, Orangestad. The last dated eruption produced pyroclastic flows about 1,600 years ago.",

Block-and-ash flow and surge deposits associated with dome growth predominate in flank deposits, including those from an eruption that likely preceded the 1632 CE settlement of the island, allowing cultivation on recently devegetated land to near the summit. Non-eruptive seismic swarms occurred at 30-year intervals in the 20th century, but no historical eruptions were recorded until 1995. Long-term small-to-moderate ash eruptions beginning in that year were later accompanied by lava-dome growth and pyroclastic flows that forced evacuation of the southern half of the island and ultimately destroyed the capital city of Plymouth, causing major social and economic disruption.",

Construction of the Grand DÃ©couverte volcano about 200,000 years ago was followed a Plinian eruption and caldera formation about 100,000 years later, and then by construction of the CarmichaÃ«l volcano within the caldera. Two episodes of edifice collapse and associated large debris avalanches formed the CarmichaÃ«l and Amic craters about 11,500 and 3,100 years ago, respectively. The present volcano subsequently grew within the Amic crater. The summit consists of a flat-topped lava dome, and several other domes occur on the southern flanks. Six phreatic explosive eruptions since 1690 opened radial fractures across the summit lava dome. The phreatic eruptions in 1976-77 caused severe economic disruption when Basse-Terre, the island's capital city immediately below the volcano, was evacuated.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Archipel de la Guadeloupe (Caribbean), a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The complex overall includes seven andesitic lava domes with a central depression where a cold soufriere is located. A chain of lava domes, two of which form a peninsula on the SW flank, form an E-W belt across the S flank. Bathymetry shows a double-peaked lava dome (known informally as Twin Peaks) off the northern coast, truncated by a 4-km-long fault-bounded cliff. No eruptions are known in historical time, although the volcano has a youthful appearance and activity at flank domes likely continued into the late-Pleistocene and Holocene. The youngest (NW) summit crater contains an active thermal area with bubbling springs. Severe earthquake swarms in 1841 and 1893 were associated with either Morne aux Diables or Morne Diablotins to the south.

The domes are located along the margin of a large semi-circular depression on the western coast of central Dominica, whose origin has been variously attributed to caldera collapse, gravity sliding, or the juxtaposition of several independent volcanic centers. The area is the source of the voluminous, mostly submarine Roseau Tuff, a thick sequence of pyroclastic flows erupted between about 40,000 and 25,000 years ago. It is considered to have originated from calderas at Morne Trois Piton and Wotten Waven, the latter an elliptical NE-SW-trending caldera containing Microtin at its NE end. Explosive eruptions at the Trois Piton-Microtin complex producing pyroclastic flows continued into the late Pleistocene and Holocene. The youngest dated eruption took place about 800 CE, but other smaller eruptions may have occurred since.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Morne Trois Pitons National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The 3.5 x 5 km caldera formed about 32-39,000 years ago in conjunction with the eruption of the Choiseul Tuff. A larger depression has been interpreted to have formed by edifice collapse, and bathymetry has identified large submarine debris-avalanche deposits off the west coast of the island. This depression and associated volcanic vents and geothermal areas is also known as the SoufriÃ¨re volcanic centre. Numerous resurgent post-caldera lava domes fill the caldera floor. The latest dated magmatic eruptions took place about 20,000 years ago, but younger undated lava domes and explosion craters are present. The only known Holocene eruptive activity was a minor phreatic eruption in the Sulfur Springs geothermal area in 1766 CE that ejected a thin ash layer over a wide area. A volcanic earthquake swarm centered 6 km ESE of the caldera occurred in 1990.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Pitons Management Area, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The crater itself lies on the SW margin of a larger 2.2-km-wide caldera, which is breached widely to the SW as a result of slope failure. Frequent explosive eruptions after about 4,300 years ago produced pyroclastic deposits of the Yellow Tephra Formation, which cover much of the island. The first historical eruption took place in 1718; it and the 1812 eruption produced major explosions. Much of the northern end of the island was devastated by a major eruption in 1902 that coincided with the catastrophic Mont PelÃ©e eruption on Martinique. A lava dome was emplaced in the summit crater in 1971 during a strictly effusive eruption, forming an island within a lake that filled the crater. A series of explosive eruptions in 1979 destroyed the 1971 dome and ejected the lake; a new dome was then built.",

Bathymetry also revealed another submarine cone to the SE, Kick 'em Jack, and submarine lava domes to its S. These and subaerial tuff rings and lava flows at Ile de Caille and other nearby islands may represent a single large volcanic complex. Numerous eruptions have occurred since 1939, mostly documented by acoustic signals. Prior to the 1939 eruption, when an eruption cloud rose 275 m above the ocean and was witnessed by a large number of people in northern Grenada, there had been no written mention of the volcano. Eruptions have involved both explosive activity and the quiet extrusion of lava flows and lava domes in the summit crater; deep rumbling noises have sometimes been heard onshore. Recent eruptions have modified the morphology of the summit crater.",

The roughly 7 x 11 km central caldera lies beneath the western part of the massive HofsjÃ¶kull icecap. A small Holocene shield volcano is located at the SW margin of the icecap. Flank fissures north and east of the icecap have produced basaltic lava flows during the Holocene. KerlingarfjÃ¶ll, a glacially dissected, largely Pleistocene rhyolitic central volcano located SW of the HofsjÃ¶kull icecap, is considered part of this volcanic system. Steep-sided Pleistocene rhyolitic lava domes and numerous hot springs occupy two calderas at the center of the 5 x 7 km wide complex. Fumarolic activity at KerlingarfjÃ¶ll, mostly concentrated in the center of the complex, is the most vigorous in Iceland.",

Although most recorded eruptions have taken place from fissures inside the caldera, the EldgjÃ¡ fissure system, which extends about 60 km to the NE from the current ice margin towards GrÃ­msvÃ¶tn volcano, has been the source of major Holocene eruptions. An eruption from the EldgjÃ¡ fissure system about 934 CE produced a voluminous lava flow of about 18 km3, one of the world's largest known Holocene lava flows. Katla has been the source of frequent subglacial basaltic explosive eruptions that have been among the largest tephra-producers in Iceland during historical time and has also produced numerous dacitic explosive eruptions during the Holocene.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Katla, a UNESCO Global Geopark property.",

With about 225 km3 of silicic extrusive rocks exposed, it comprises the largest area of silicic and intermediate volcanism in Iceland. Work by Moles et al. (2019) identified the Ring Fracture Rhyolites as the source of the rhyolitic and trachyandesitic ThÃ³rsmÃ¶rk Ignimbrite and the II-RHY-1 tephra, and dated them at 51.3 Â± 4.2 ka (40Ar/39Ar). The dominantly rhyolitic complex rises about 500 m above surrounding basaltic plains and is elongated WNW-ESE. Most rhyolitic lava flows were erupted subglacially, with silicic hyaloclastites that form ridge and dome-shaped breccias. During postglacial times only a narrow fissure zone at the western end has been active, producing mostly silicic lava flows, domes, and tephras. The most recent silicic eruption produced the Hrafntinnuhraun flow about 900 CE. The fissure system is along trend with and was active at the same time as the basaltic VeidivÃ¶tn fissure system of BÃ¡rdarbunga central volcano in 1477 CE. The small TorfajÃ¶kull icecap lies mostly outside the SE rim of the caldera, which is the site of vigorous thermal activity over a broad area of 130-140 km2.",

Repeated eruptions along this rift, which is oblique to most rifting structures in the eastern volcanic zone, are responsible for Hekla's elongated ENE-WSW profile. Frequent large silicic explosive eruptions during historical time have deposited tephra throughout Iceland, providing valuable time markers used to date eruptions from other Icelandic volcanoes. Hekla tephras are generally rich in fluorine and are consequently very hazardous to grazing animals. Extensive lava flows from historical eruptions, which date back to 1104 CE, cover much of the volcano's flanks.",

The most prominent of these is the noted Laki (Skaftar) fissure, which extends to the SW and produced the world's largest known historical lava flow in 1783. The 15 km3 basaltic Laki lavas were erupted over 7 months from a 27-km-long fissure system.

A major rhyolitic explosive eruption from DyngjufjÃ¶ll about 10,000 years ago was in part associated with the formation of Askja caldera. Many postglacial eruptions also occurred along the ring-fracture. A major explosive eruption on the SE caldera margin in 1875 was one of Iceland's largest during historical time. It resulted in the formation of a smaller 4.5-km-wide caldera, now filled by Ãskjuvatn lake, that truncates the rim of the larger central caldera. The 100-km-long Askja fissure swarm, which includes the Sveinagja graben, is also related to the Askja volcanic system, as are several small shield volcanoes such as Kollatadyngja. Twentieth-century eruptions have produced lava flows from vents located mostly near Ãskjuvatn lake.",

It has been moderately active in the Holocene, over three distinct eruptive periods; the current one has lasted about 2,800 years with six volcano-tectonic episodes, each with one or more basaltic fissure eruptions. Lava volumes (DRE) have been in the 0.1-1 km3 range. The Hverfjall and Ludent tuff rings east of Myvatn were erupted along the fissure system. Myvatn lake formed during the eruption of the older Laxarhraun lava flow from the Ketildyngja shield volcano of the Fremrinamur volcanic system about 3,800 years before present (BP); The present Myvatn lake is constrained by the roughly 2,000 years BP younger Laxarhraun lava flow from the Krafla volcanic system. The abundant pseudocraters that form a prominent part of the Myvatn landscape were created when the younger Laxarhraun lava flow entered the lake. The last eruption took place in 1975-1984 CE when nine small basaltic fissure eruptions produced 0.25 km3 of lava.",

Thick pumice deposits thought to originate from the Picos system may have originated from vents or a caldera destroyed and now buried by young basaltic volcanism. The most noteworthy of the young vents is Serra Gorda, SE of Siete Cidades, and the cone that produced a lava delta south of Agua de Paul village. The majority of the inhabitants of Sao Miguel Island occupy both coasts below this volcanic zone. At least 18 eruptions have occurred during the past 2,800 years, although the only recorded eruption occurred in 1652 CE. The most recent activity has been basaltic; however, two more-explosive trachytic eruptions occurred during the past 1,100 years.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Azores, a UNESCO Global Geopark property.",

Construction of the volcano along E-W-trending rift zones from the Miocene to about 700,000 years ago was followed by a period of extensive erosion and possible edifice collapse. Two steep-walled amphitheaters open to south in the central part of the island. Late-stage eruptions are scattered throughout the island and lasted until the Holocene, producing scoria cones and intracanyon lava flows mantling rocks of the older eroded edifice. The youngest activity at Madeira lies in the west-central part of the island, and consists of cinder cones in the upper Sao Vicente valley, a series of intracanyon flows, and a tephra layer on top of the Paul da Serra plateau dated at about 6500 years ago.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Santana Madeira, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

On the south, the younger Cumbre Vieja volcano is one of the most active in the Canaries. The elongated volcano dates back to about 125,000 years ago and is oriented N-S. Eruptions during the past 7,000 years have formed abundant cinder cones and craters along the axis, producing fissure-fed lava flows that descend steeply to the sea. Eruptions recorded since the 15th century have produced mild explosive activity and lava flows that damaged populated areas. The southern tip of the island is mantled by a broad lava field emplaced during the 1677-1678 eruption. Lava flows also reached the sea in 1585, 1646, 1712, 1949, 1971, and 2021.\n\nThis volcano is located within the La Palma (Canary Islands), a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

Three prominent rifts oriented NW, NE, and S form prominent topographic ridges. The subaerial portion of the volcano consists of flat-lying Quaternary basaltic and trachybasaltic lava flows and tuffs capped by numerous young cinder cones and lava flows. Holocene cones and flows are found both on the outer flanks and in the El Golfo depression. Hierro contains the greatest concentration of young vents in the Canary Islands. Uncertainty surrounds the report of an eruption in 1793.

The origin of the 10 x 17 km Las CaÃ±adas caldera, partially filled by the Teide stratovolcano, has been variably considered to be due to collapse following multiple major explosive eruptions or as a result of a massive landslide (in a manner similar to the earlier formation of the massive La Orotava and Guimar valleys), or a combination of the two processes. The most recent stage of activity beginning in the late Pleistocene included the construction of the Pico Viejo and Teide edifices. Tenerife was perhaps observed in eruption by Christopher Columbus, and several flank vents on the Canary Island's most active volcano have been active during historical time.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Teide National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The largest historical eruption of the Canary Islands took place during 1730-36, when long-term eruptions from a fissure formed the MontaÃ±as del Fuego and produced voluminous lava flows that covered about 200 km2. The lava flows reached the western coast along a broad, 20-km-wide front. The villages of Maretas and Santa Catalina were destroyed, along with the most fertile valleys and estates on the island. An eruption during 1824 produced a much smaller lava flow that reached the SW coast.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Lanzarote and Chinijo Islands, a UNESCO Global Geopark property.",

The roughly circular 25-km-wide island is truncated by a large 9-km-wide caldera that is breached to the east and has a headwall 1 km high. The caldera is located asymmetrically NE of the center of the island and was formed as a result of massive lateral collapse of the ancestral Monte Armarelo edifice. A very youthful steep-sided central cone, Pico, rises more than 1 km above the caldera floor to about 100 m above the caldera rim, forming the 2829 m high point of the island. Pico, which is capped by a 500-m-wide, 150-m-deep summit crater, was apparently in almost continuous activity from the time of Portuguese settlement in 1500 CE until around 1760. Later historical lava flows, some from vents on the caldera floor, reached the eastern coast below the breached caldera.",

Ship captains have reported numerous submarine eruptions during the 18th and 19th centuries over a broad area in this part of the Atlantic, including descriptions of seaquakes, turbulent water, columns of smoke, floating pumice, submarine banks, or small ephemeral islands. These accounts were tentatively collectively assigned by the CAVW to a seamount along the Romanche Fracture Zone, although their locations span a broad area up to 400 km W of the assigned location. Floating \"volcanic ash\" was collected in 1836 from a site near the Mid-Atlantic Rift, well E of the seamount. The validity of these reports is not clear, although three of these events were considered by the CAVW to possibly represent submarine eruptions.",

The isolated island is dotted with more than 100 youthful parasitic cones and lava domes, many aligned along two fissures.

Although no eruptive activity has occurred since its discovery, many volcanic features have a very youthful appearance. Two of the youngest lava flows were erupted from flank vents and reached the sea on the N and S coasts.

Radial dike swarms are prominently exposed on all sides of the island. Numerous Strombolian cinder cones occur on the flanks along both concentric ring structures and NNW- and ENE-trending radial fissures.

A number of very young-looking cones are located at the summit and on the flanks. Tephra layers are found within and on top of ice layers, and the most recent eruption was estimated to have occurred between 1862 and 1922. The volcano displays fumarolic activity that is concentrated along a NNE-SSW line cutting through the summit area and along a line of phreatomagmatic craters on the southern rim of the summit crater. Prominent ice towers and pinnacles were formed from steam condensation around fumarolic vents.",

A summit plateau at about 3,200 m elevation marks the rim of the youngest caldera, which formed during the late-Pleistocene and within which the modern cone was constructed. An elliptical 500 x 600 m wide, 110-m-deep crater truncates the summit and contains an active lava lake within a 250-m-wide, 100-m-deep inner crater; other lava lakes are sometimes present. The glacier-covered volcano was erupting when first sighted by Captain James Ross in 1841.

Two early Holocene phreatomagmatic tephra layers in the Antarctic ice core were attributed to Takahe (Palais et al., 1988).

It was constructed along the axis of the Bransfield Rift spreading center between the Shetland and Wedell tectonic plates. Bridgeman is located east of King George Island at the NE end of the South Shetland Islands, north of the tip of Graham Land Peninsula. The island has a gently sloping top consisting of truncated lava flows. Steep cliffs surrounding the island expose older lavas and bedded pyroclastic rocks. The extensively eroded volcano does not display youthful volcanic features, although it has been characterized as a now inactive late Pleistocene-Holocene stratovolcano. Several reports of 19th-century fumarolic activity (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World) may instead refer to the much younger Penguin Island (GonzÃ¡lez-FerrÃ¡n, 1972).",

Another possible submarine caldera lies east of Cook Island and south of basaltic-andesite Bellingshausen, the easternmost island. The age of Cook Island is uncertain, but steam was observed at the summit crater of Thule Island in 1962, and ash was seen on the surface of the ice there and on Bellingshausen Island, indicating possible 20th-century eruptions (Baker, 1968). Bellingshausen has a youthful, relatively ice-free profile and an extensive well-preserved lava field on its S flank, where a small explosion crater formed sometime between 1964 and 1986.",

A steep-sided flank cone or lava dome, Havfruen Peak, is located on the east side, and a young crater and fissure are on the west flank. Three large sea stacks lying off Turmoil Point at the western tip of the island may be remnants of an older now-eroded volcanic center. Both summit and flank vents have been active during historical time. The latest eruption, during 1956, originated from the west-flank crater, and deposited cinder over the icecap. The extensive icecap and the difficulty of landing make it the least explored of the South Sandwich Islands.",

Around 90% of the island is ice-covered; glaciers extending to the sea typically form vertical ice cliffs. The name Mount Belinda has been applied both to the high point at the southern end of the summit caldera and to the young central cone. Mount Oceanite, an isolated peak at the SE tip of the island, was the source of lava flows exposed at Mathias Point and Allen Point. There was no record of Holocene activity until MODIS satellite data, beginning in late 2001, revealed thermal anomalies consistent with lava lake activity. Apparent plumes and single anomalous pixels were observed intermittently on AVHRR images from March 1995 to February 1998, possibly indicating earlier volcanic activity.",

The young Mount Michael stratovolcano dominates the glacier-covered island, while two submarine plateaus, Harpers Bank and Saunders Bank, extend north. The symmetrical Michael has a 500-m-wide summit crater and a remnant of a somma rim to the SE. Tephra layers visible in ice cliffs surrounding the island are evidence of recent eruptions. Ash clouds were reported from the summit crater in 1819, and an effusive eruption was inferred to have occurred from a N-flank fissure around the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. A low ice-free lava platform, Blackstone Plain, is located on the north coast, surrounding a group of former sea stacks. A cluster of parasitic cones on the SE flank, the Ashen Hills, appear to have been modified since 1820 (LeMasurier and Thomson, 1990). Analysis of satellite imagery available since 1989 (Gray et al., 2019; MODVOLC) suggests frequent eruptive activity (when weather conditions allow), volcanic clouds, steam plumes, and thermal anomalies indicative of a persistent, or at least frequently active, lava lake in the summit crater. Due to this observational bias, there has been a presumption when defining eruptive periods that activity has been ongoing unless there is no evidence for at least 10 months.",

Individual vents spread across a broad NW-SE-trending area extending about 50 km from the towns of Ormont on the NW to Bad Bertrich on the SE. Eruptions originated from a mantle plume through Devonian sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Two-thirds of the volcanic centers in the field are scoria cones; lava flows have been produced from about half of them. About 30% of the centers are maars or tuff rings, many of which are occupied by lakes. About 230 eruptions have occurred during the past 730,000 years. The latest eruptions formed the Ulmener, Pulvermaar, and Strohn maars around the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Vulkaneifel, a UNESCO Global Geopark property.",

Subsequent eruptions occurred from a new 5-km-wide central cone and from many phreatomagmatic craters and cones within the Artemisio-Tuscolana caldera and on its outer flanks. The post-caldera eruptions have buried the western side of the caldera rim. The largest of the post-caldera craters is Lake Albano, a 2.5 x 4 km compound maar constructed at the WSW margin of the caldera in multiple stages dating back to about 69,000 years ago. The age of the most recent eruptions from the Albano maar is not known precisely; variable dates range from about 36,000 years ago to perhaps the Holocene, when several possibly non-volcanic lake overflow lahars occurred. Reported eruptions during the Roman period are uncertain, but subsequent seismic swarms lasting up to two years have been recorded.",

The caldera formed following two large explosive eruptions, the massive Campanian ignimbrite about 36,000 BP, and the over 40 km3 Neapolitan Yellow Tuff (NYT) about 15,000 BP. Following eruption of the NYT a large number of eruptions originated from widely scattered subaerial and submarine vents. Most activity occurred during three intervals: 15,000-9,500, 8,600-8,200, and 4,800-3,800 BP. The latest eruption were in 1158 CE at Solfatara and activity in 1538 CE that formed the Monte Nuovo cinder cone.",

The historically active cone of Vesuvius was constructed within a large caldera of the ancestral Monte Somma volcano, thought to have formed incrementally beginning about 17,000 years ago. The Monte Somma caldera wall has channeled lava flows and pyroclastic flows primarily to the south and west. Eight major explosive eruptions have taken place in the last 17,000 years, often accompanied by large pyroclastic flows and surges, such as during the well-known 79 CE Pompeii eruption. Intermittent eruptions since 79 CE were followed by a period of frequent long-term explosive and effusive eruptions between 1631 and 1944. The large 1631 eruption produced pyroclastic flows that reached as far as the coast and caused great destruction. Many towns are located on the volcano's flanks, and several million people live within areas that could be affected by eruptions.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Somma Vesuvio and Miglio d'oro, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The high point on the island, Monte Epomeo, is a volcanic horst composed of the Green Tuff ignimbrite deposit that was submerged after its eruption and then uplifted. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; at least 800 m of uplift has formed as a result of resurgent doming during past 33,000 years. Many small monogenetic volcanoes were formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous tephras, tuff rings, lava domes, and lava flows, and a major collapse of Mount Epomeo produced a large submarine debris-avalanche deposit. The latest eruption, in 1302 CE, produced a spatter cone and the Arso lava flow, which reached the NE coast.",

The Neostromboli eruptive period took place between about 13,000 and 5,000 years ago. The active summit vents are located at the head of the Sciara del Fuoco, a prominent scarp that formed about 5,000 years ago due to a series of slope failures which extends to below sea level. The modern volcano has been constructed within this scarp, which funnels pyroclastic ejecta and lava flows to the NW. Essentially continuous mild Strombolian explosions, sometimes accompanied by lava flows, have been recorded for more than a millennium.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Isole Eolie (Aeolian Islands), a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Panarea, the smallest island in the Aeolian Archipelago, lies on the western side of a shallow platform whose shelf margin is at about 130 m depth. A series of small islands breach the surface to form the Central Reefs, the rim of a crater 2 km E of Panarea, whose shallow submerged floor contains Roman ruins. The submerged Secca dei Pesci lava dome lies at the SE end of the platform, and the rhyolitic Basiluzzo lava dome rises 165 m above the surface at the NE end, along a ridge trending towards Stromboli volcano. The complex was constructed in two main stages: an initial effusive activity phase that produced lava domes, and an explosive stage. The youngest subaerial airfall-tephra deposits are dated to about 20,000 years ago; a date of less then 10,000 BP on a lava flow is uncertain. Vigorous hydrothermal activity has continued at fumarolic fields at several locations on the submerged platform; submarine hydrothermal explosions have occurred in historical time.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Isole Eolie (Aeolian Islands), a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The second eruptive period from about 102 to 53 ka included the formation of the Monte San Angelo and Costa d'Agosto stratovolcanoes in the center of the island. The third eruptive cycle (40 ka to the present) included the Monte Guardia sequence, erupted at the southern tip of the island between about 22,600 and 16,800 years ago, and Holocene rhyolitic pyroclastic deposits and obsidian lava flows at the NE end of the island. The latest eruption, at Monte Pilato on the NE tip of the island, formed the Rocche Rosse and Forgia Vecchia obsidian lava flows, which have been dated variously from about 500 to 1230 CE. Objects made of obsidian from Lipari have been found throughout southern Italy.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Isole Eolie (Aeolian Islands), a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

La Fossa cone, active throughout the Holocene and the location of most historical eruptions, occupies the 3-km-wide Caldera della Fossa at the NW end of the elongated 3 x 7 km island. The Vulcanello lava platform is a low, roughly circular peninsula on the northern tip of Vulcano that was formed as an island beginning more than 2,000 years ago and was connected to the main island in about 1550 CE. Vulcanello is capped by three pyroclastic cones and was active intermittently until the 16th century. Explosive activity took place at the Fossa cone from 1898 to 1900.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Isole Eolie (Aeolian Islands), a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The Mongibello stratovolcano, truncated by several small calderas, was constructed during the late Pleistocene and Holocene over an older shield volcano. The most prominent morphological feature of Etna is the Valle del Bove, a 5 x 10 km caldera open to the east. Two styles of eruptive activity typically occur, sometimes simultaneously. Persistent explosive eruptions, sometimes with minor lava emissions, take place from one or more summit craters. Flank vents, typically with higher effusion rates, are less frequently active and originate from fissures that open progressively downward from near the summit (usually accompanied by Strombolian eruptions at the upper end). Cinder cones are commonly constructed over the vents of lower-flank lava flows. Lava flows extend to the foot of the volcano on all sides and have reached the sea over a broad area on the SE flank.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Mount Etna, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The 6-km-wide Cinque Denti caldera, the youngest of the two calderas, formed about 45,000 years ago and contains the two post-caldera shield volcanoes of Monte Grande and Monte Gibele. Holocene eruptions have constructed pumice cones, lava domes, and short, blocky lava flows. Many Holocene vents are located on three sides of the uplifted Montagna Grande block on the SE side of the island.

Potassium-Argon ages for the older part of the complex range from 900,000 to 550,000 years, although activity may have begun during the late Pliocene. A younger phase of activity took place from about 380,000-290,000 years ago, forming a series of lava domes and flows. The youngest dome, Kameno Vouno, on the NW side of the peninsula, was formed in the 3rd century BCE and produced a lava flow that traveled 500 m beyond the coastline. Hot springs are found at several locations along the coast of the peninsula.",

The age of the caldera is variously considered to be less than 24,000 years before present (BP) (Keller et al., 1990) and older than 44,000 years BP (Limburg and Varekamp, 1991). Five large post-caldera lava domes completely fill the western part of the caldera. The NE-most (Boriatiko) and SW-most (Karaviotis) lava domes and flows are significantly younger than the other domes. A sixth post-caldera dome, outside the SW caldera rim, produced lava flows that reached the coast. Historical phreatic eruptions occurred from craters within the caldera between 1422 and 1888. Intense hydrothermal activity continues in the form of many fumaroles on the caldera floor and hot springs along the coast.",

Interpretations of Neolithic paintings representing eruptions are controversial, but geologic evidence supports eruptive activity continuing into the Holocene. Uslular et al.

Growth of the modern edifice began about 900,000 years ago, following Pliocene caldera collapse of the Kocdag complex. The youngest dated rock was from an 83,000-year-old dacitic lava flow, but rhyodacitic eruptions and lava dome growth occurred later at the Perikartin dome. One of the latest documented events was an edifice collapse that produced a large debris avalanche that extended to the east. An early Holocene distal tephra layer in Lebanon was attributed to Erciyes Dagi. Uncertainty remains regarding reported eruptions and their possible depiction on Roman Cappadocian coins. Accounts possibly referring to eruptions could also be attributed to methane releases from a swamp in the Sultansazligi Basin.",

It contains a 9 x 5 km caldera partially filled on its western side by a caldera lake. Post-caldera volcanism, of basaltic to rhyolitic composition, initially occurred along the caldera rim and floor. Pyroclastic flows and the emission of glassy obsidian lava flows accompanied construction of lava domes within the caldera; later activity formed a series of cinder cones and lava domes erupted along N-S-trending fissures on the northern flank. The most recent activity has been concentrated along a NNW-trending fissure cutting the eastern caldera floor and extending beyond the north caldera rim; nearly two dozen cinder cones and lava domes were constructed on the caldera floor. Ash layers in Lake Van document numerous Holocene eruptions, and an historical eruption in 1441 CE from a N-flank fissure involved compositionally bimodal lava flows.",

The higher western cone is capped by a steep-walled crater with a trachytic spine at its eastern edge. The flatter eastern crater contains a warm lake. The shield volcano developed during a period when highly mobile lava flows from the western crater covered an area of 500 km2. Following summit caldera formation, numerous flank eruptions took place from N-S-trending fissures, producing viscous trachytic lava domes and flows as well as fluid basaltic pahoehoe flows that extend 10-20 km N and S. The latest activity formed two major basaltic lava flows from large cones on the NE and SE flanks. An eruption took place from a vent on the SE flank about 2500 years ago, and a gas-and-ash eruption took place in 1855.",

Construction of the Greater and Lesser Ararat volcanoes was followed by a period of extensive flank eruptions, many erupted along N-S fissures. The initial stage of flank eruptions produced a cluster of cinder cones and dacitic-rhyolitic lava domes surrounding Greater Ararat and a series of pyroclastic cones and domes on the W flank of Lesser Ararat. Late-stage activity formed large pyroclastic cones lower on the flanks of the two volcanoes. Ararat appears to have been active during the 3rd millennium BCE; pyroclastic-flow deposits overlie early Bronze Age artifacts and human remains. Karakhanian et al. (2002) reported historical evidence for a phreatic eruption and pyroclastic flow at the time of a July 1840 earthquake and landslide.",

Oswald (1906) noted that steep escarpments of Nummulitic limestones faced the âDalykh-tapaâ volcano, about 6 km NE across an extensive lava-flow field. Near the north end of the approximately 5 x 8 km flow field the 1.5-km-diameter cone rises about 300 m above the surrounding lavas, identified by Sviatlovsky (1959) as post-glacial. At the southern end of the flow field a fissure-fed lava flow several thousand years ago dammed the Arpah River near the town of Vyke and then flowed NW for 6 km; the flows overlie a late Pleistocene terrace and have little soil development (Karakhanian et al., 2002). The youthful-looking Smbatassar cinder cone, 17 km NW of Vaiyots-Sar, appears to be the source vent for Holocene lava flows that traveled 11 km N and 17 km S down two valleys (Karakhanian et al., 2002).",

It was constructed along the active Pambak-Sevan strike-slip fault, which has bisected the mid-Pleistocene Khonarassar volcano, separating its two halves by about 800 m. Two large lava flows traveled up to 21 km north and NW, and fresh-looking lava flows form peninsulas extending into Lake Alagyol. Fifth century BCE petroglyphs were interpreted to depict volcanic eruptions (Karakhanian et al., 2002). Porak is referred to in a famous cuneiform inscription as Mount Bamni, and stratigraphic and archeological evidence indicates that an explosive eruption also producing a lava flow occurred at the time of a military battle dated to 782-773 BCE.",

Dalafilla, also referred to as Gabuli, is a steep-sided cone that rises 300 m above surrounding lava fields due to extrusion of viscous, silicic lava flows. Basaltic lava flows from regional fissures surround the volcano. Fumarolic activity occurs in the 100-m-wide summit crater and has weathered surrounding lava flows.

The two most-recent eruptive centers are fissure systems that extend NW-SE and NNE-SSW. The former produced lava flows that reached the Red Sea in 1400 CE. The second created 19 small craters at the summit in 1861. Ash fell more than 300 km from the volcano. Two villages were destroyed and more than 100 people were killed during Africa's largest eruption in historical time. Lava flows from the 1861 eruption traveled as far as 22 km and reached the coast.",

Magma-water interaction has produced tuff cones, some of which form islands or are breached by the sea. The most recent lava flows are younger than lake sediments deposited 5,300 years ago. These lavas were thought to have been erupted during the past 3,000 years (Delibrias et al., 1975).

(2022), it has followed an evolutionary pattern similar to other caldera volcanoes within the MER, beginning with a shield-building phase of peralkaline rhyolite lava flows, followed by at least one caldera-forming eruption, the inferred deposits of which are dated to ca. 182 Â± 28 ka (Hutchison et al., 2016). Subsequent volcanism focused around three post-caldera edifices (Artu, Urji, and Chabbi) and a rhyolitic cone (Biftu Tuff Cone), situated outside the south-eastern caldera wall.... The eroded remains of Artu cone partly cover the northeastern section of the caldera, and younger products from Chabbi shield entirely cover the eastern portion of the caldera wall.\" The Wendo Koshe Younger Pumice (WKYP) has been 14C dated by Rapprich et al. (2016) to around 396 BCE; stratigraphic correlations indicate more recent eruptions, including four obsidian lava flows (Rapprich et al., 2016) and possibly two smaller explosive eruptions (Colby et al., 2022). Additional undated deposits are present between the WKYP event and the formation of the Biftu Tuff Cone after 5425 BCE (Colby et al., 2022).",

The field includes 114 monogenetic centers, primarily cinder cones and some maars; the largest maar is the 2.3-km-diameter El Sod. Uneroded lava flows often partially overly deeply eroded lava flows. Large lava flows are usually associated with cinder cones, but fissure-fed flows in the Megado area exhibit oriented spatter ramparts. One of the largest lava flows extends more than 10 km SW from the Mega escarpment and covers about 25 km2; it has a very fresh, black, glassy appearance of the surface, and minimal vegetation. Two samples analyzed by Franceschini et al. (2020) yielded 40Ar/39Ar ages of 0.116 Â± 0.005 and 0.044 Â± 0.008 Ma; two other samples indicated very recent Holocene ages. These are the first age dates available for this field, and are in agreement with the morphological interpretation of some young cinder cones and lava flows.",

Two fresh unvegetated lava flows that reach the lake shore from the central tuff ring form lava deltas on the N and W sides of the island; the northern delta is about 900 m wide. The two blocky lava flows are younger than a terrace that formed less than 10,000 years ago during the last major high-water level (Key and Watkins, 1988).

Several small islands to the SE represent partially submerged crater rims, and other cones and lava plugs lie beneath the lake surface near the island. The youngest tuffs and lavas may be as young as Holocene (Karson and Curtis, 1992). Fumarolic activity is concentrated along the NE-to-SE rim of the central crater, and sprays of sulfur from the fumaroles were observed by visitors in the 1930s. In 1974 intense emission of molten sulfur and steam clouds were seen from the mainland.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Lake Turkana National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The main phase of shield construction occurred during the Pliocene. Quaternary activity shifted to explosive activity that formed maars accompanied by further extensive effusion of lava flows. The youngest dated lava flow has a Potassium-Argon age of 0.68 Â± 0.16 million years, but more recent activity has also occurred. The youngest lava flows are unvegetated, and Key (1987) mapped the post-shield cinder cones as Pleistocene-to-Recent in age.",

The activity produced fissure-controlled subaerial basaltic scoria cones and lava flows, and partially or completely sub-lacustral tuff cones, tuff rings, and pillow lavas. Fluid olivine basalts were also erupted from a breached scoria cone, forming the summit. The youngest eruptions postdated the drying out of Lake Sugata about 3000 years ago. Some could be as recent as the historical eruptions at The Barrier volcano to the north (Dunkley et al., 1993).

A NNE-SSW-trending chain of lake-filled basaltic maars extends along the floor of the rift from the lower flanks of the volcano. Young lava flows were also erupted from vents along rift valley faults. Well-preserved parasitic cones erupted along rift-parallel faults cutting the volcano abound; the latest eruption produced a trachytic lava flow dated from secular magnetic variation measurements at about the beginning of the 20th century. Fumarolic activity and hot steaming ground occurs along NNE-trending fissures within the caldera and along the lower NW flanks.",

An impressive 5 x 8 km summit caldera with 300 m deep walls is thought to have formed about 63,000 years ago. Caldera formation is thought to have been incremental, related to eruption of the Kantenmening basaltic and trachytic lava flows. A series of summit-area lava benches formed by eruptions from circumferential fissures has produced a volcano morphologically similar to Galapagos Islands volcanoes. The N, E, and S flanks are cut by a prominent broad rift zone 10 km wide and 30 km long, dotted with numerous pyroclastic cones. Lava domes on the upper E flank formed during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, until about 7 ka. Youthful parasitic cones abound on the caldera floor and on the N and NE flanks; the youngest lava flows may be little more than a few hundred years old (Williams et al. 1984). Geothermal activity occurs within the caldera and on the upper E flanks.",

A second large crater SE of the caldera is 0.5 x 1 km wide and contains a pumice cone. The summit caldera is narrowly breached on the N side, which has funneled post-caldera lava flows in this direction. The three youngest post-caldera pyroclastic cones on the NE flank may be only a few hundred years old. A series of viscous trachytic lava flows were erupted from vents on the lower flanks. Young fissure-fed basalts were also erupted to the S, between Paka and Korosi volcanoes.

This was followed by the eruption of trachytic lava domes and pumice/scoria cones. The youngest activity, consisting of fissure-fed basaltic lava flows on the lower N flanks between Korosi and Paka, was probably coeval with the latest eruptions on Ol Kokwe to the S, which are only a few hundred to a few thousand years old (Dunkley et al. 1993).

Its large elongated summit crater is truncated on the north by a ring graben. This unusual 5-km-wide circular graben at the center of the older caldera isolates a tilted island block of caldera-floor lava flows.

The cone-building stage ended about 15,000 years ago and was followed by periodic ejection of natrocarbonatitic and nephelinite tephra during the Holocene. Historical eruptions have consisted of smaller tephra ejections and emission of numerous natrocarbonatitic lava flows on the floor of the summit crater and occasionally down the upper flanks. The depth and morphology of the northern crater have changed dramatically during the course of historical eruptions, ranging from steep crater walls about 200 m deep in the mid-20th century to shallow platforms mostly filling the crater. Long-term lava effusion in the summit crater beginning in 1983 had by the turn of the century mostly filled the northern crater; by late 1998 lava had begun overflowing the crater rim.",

Many of the cinder cones are aligned along dominantly NW-trending older faults and younger NNE-trending fissures. The silica contents of the lava flows increased with time. Early flows consisted of foidites; later Holocene lava flows are basanites and alkali basalts. Six tephra deposits from Lake Chala were attibuted by Martin-Jones et al.

A second vent between it and the headwall produced lava flows that cover much of the caldera floor. Kisaka et al.

Two pyroclastic cones with well-preserved craters are present, with a central cone and crater adjacent to the NE crater that contains a solidified lava lake. The NE crater is the largest feature, at 370 m in diameter, and has been breached on the ENE side; this was the source of a lava flow about 1 km long and wide. The SW crater is also breached on the ENE side, with a smaller lava flow on the E flank. Cosmogenic Helium ages for the Igwisi Hills eruption with wide uncertainties range from late Pleistocene to mid-Holocene (Brown et al., 2012).",

Numerous pyroclastic cones are situated along the ridge. Eruption of the Kitulo Pumice, radiocarbon dated at about 10,200 cal. years before present, is though to be related to formation of the caldera. The youngest activity appears to have originated from the caldera and from youthful-looking pyroclastic cones to the north; the youngest known eruption produced a pyroclastic flow that swept at least 10 km S about 500 years ago.",

Benches in the steep-walled, 1.2-km-wide summit crater mark levels of former lava lakes, which have been observed since the late-19th century. Two older stratovolcanoes, Baruta and Shaheru, are partially overlapped by Nyiragongo on the north and south. About 100 parasitic cones are located primarily along radial fissures south of Shaheru, east of the summit, and along a NE-SW zone extending as far as Lake Kivu. Many cones are buried by voluminous lava flows that extend long distances down the flanks, which is characterized by the eruption of foiditic rocks. The extremely fluid 1977 lava flows caused many fatalities, as did lava flows that inundated portions of the major city of Goma in January 2002.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Virunga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

More than 100 parasitic cones erupted along a NNE-SSW zone that extends to the shores of Lake Kivu. The youngest Potassium-Argon date obtained is about 10,000 years before present (de Mulder, 1985). The youngest eruptions produced a group of dome-shaped parasitic vents east of the caldera, which fed viscous lava flows that traveled as far as 12 km E, and lava flows from the SW-flank satellitic lava vents.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcans Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

More than 100 small cinder cones, often fissure-controlled parallel to the long axis of the 1400 km3 edifice, occur on the flanks and surrounding lowlands. A large satellitic peak, Etinde (also known as Little Cameroon), is located on the S flank near the coast. Historical activity was first observed in the 5th century BCE by the Carthaginian navigator Hannon. During historical time, moderate explosive and effusive eruptions have occurred from both summit and flank vents. A 1922 SW-flank eruption produced a lava flow that reached the Atlantic coast, and a lava flow from a 1999 south-flank eruption stopped only 200 m from the sea. Explosive activity from two vents on the upper SE flank was reported in May 2000.",

Mount Koupe, composed of Tertiary syenite, dominates the area. Activity began with the emission of large lava flows over Precambrian metamorphic rocks and Cretaceous sandstones, and concluded with explosive activity forming numerous cinder cones. The 800 km2 volcanic field, which erupted basanitic, basaltic, and trachybasaltic rocks, contains three large lake-filled maars, including Barombi Mbo, a compound maar near the town of Kumba. Legends record an eruption of Le Djungo (also known as Mont PelÃ©) that destroyed a village; though a small craterless cone is marked along a fault line on a map in Nkono (2009, after Nkouathio et al., 2002) it's unclear what cone is being described by the story, because no noticeably younger or unvegetated cones are apparent in satellite imagery. Two samples taken from the Njombe area in the farthest SW part of the field were K-Ar dated as possible Holocene (Nkouathio et al., 2008), though the error was too large to be definitive.",

The Lake Nyos event on 21 August 1986 caused at least 1,700 fatalities. The emission of ~1 km3 of magmatic carbon dioxide has been attributed either to overturn of stratified lake waters as a result of a non-volcanic process, or to phreatic explosions or injection of hot gas into the lake.",

The field was constructed over Precambrian metamorphic and plutonic rocks of the Tuareg shield. A dozen trachytic-to-rhyolitic lava domes and spines formed during the Pliocene, and Pliocene-to Pleistocene activity formed about 100 small basaltic (mostly basanitic) cones. The most recent activity, during the Pleistocene and Holocene, produced about 20 maars and cones along the northern margin.",

Basaltic scoria cones are scattered throughout the field; their lavas have produced a broad lava plateau. The central part of the field consists of younger phonolitic lava flows, trachytic pumice-fall deposits, ignimbrites, and maars. The youngest dated eruptions about 5,000 years ago produced a tuff ring and a lava flow.",

Most vents are cinder cones that produced lava flows which breached the cones. About 10% of vents in the field are explosion craters, the largest of which, named Hosh ed Dalam, is 1.3 km wide and up to 500 m deep. The youngest basalts appear to post-date the last period of moist climate in Sudan, which ended as recently as about 5,000 years ago.

Other fields include the Jabal ad Druze, Es Safa, Golan Heights, and the Kra Lava Field where radiocarbon dating indicated an eruption at 2670 BCE Â± 200 years. Although a \"boiling lava lake\" eruption has been in the volcanological literature since 1925, a translation of the original source of that report by Wetzstein (1860) clearly shows that he was describing solidified crater floor surface features and lava flows.",

Lava flows are basaltic to basanitic in composition, and the Holocene flows are alkali olivine basalts. One of the cones may have erupted around the 10th century CE or earlier.

Four coalescing lava fields erupted from offset NNW-trending vent systems comprise the field, which has an average width of 60 km. Lava flows extend as far as 100 km W of the axis of the field. Basaltic scoria cones dominate, but the volcanic field has also produced silicic trachy-basaltic to trachytic rocks. Small shield volcanoes and lava domes with associated pyroclastic flow and surge deposits are also present. Activity has migrated to the north over time, resulting in eruptions near Madinah. The best-known eruption took place in 1256 CE, when a 0.5 km3 lava flow erupted from six aligned scoria cones and traveled 23 km to within 4 km of Madinah.",

The Quaternary lava flows are of basaltic to trachybasaltic composition and contain ultramafic inclusions. Cinder cones are scattered throughout the volcanic field, with a few late-stage cones (Ba'a and Qishr) NE of the main lava field.

Baker et al.

Lava effusion has dominated, pyroclastic activity has been limited, and the only major explosive event produced a welded ignimbrite about 280,000 years ago. The youngest activity, from the summit vent, produced a series of lava flows that cover the W side of the volcano. The youngest dated lava flows were emplaced about 7,000 years ago.

Volcanism began roughly 15-10 million years ago (Pelleter et al., 2014; Nougier et al., 1986), and has included basaltic lava flows, nephelinite, tephrite, phonolitic domes, and pyroclastic deposits (Nehlig et al., 2013). Lavas on the NE were active from about 4.7 to 1.4 million years and on the south from about 7.7 to 2.7 million years. Mafic activity resumed on the north from about 2.9 to 1.2 million years and on the south from about 2 to 1.5 million years. Several pumice layers found in cores on the barrier reef-lagoon complex indicate that volcanism likely occurred less than 7,000 years ago (Zinke et al., 2003). More recent activity that began in May 2018 consisted of seismicity and ground deformation occurring offshore E of Mayotte Island (Lemoine et al., 2019). One year later, in May 2019, a new subaqueous edifice and associated lava flows were observed 50 km E of Petite Terre during an oceanographic campaign.",

Three scarps formed at about 250,000, 65,000, and less than 5,000 years ago by progressive eastward slumping, leaving caldera-sized embayments open to the E and SE. Numerous pyroclastic cones are present on the floor of the scarps and their outer flanks. Most recorded eruptions have originated from the summit and flanks of Dolomieu, a 400-m-high lava shield that has grown within the youngest scarp, which is about 9 km wide and about 13 km from the western wall to the ocean on the E side. More than 150 eruptions, most of which have produced fluid basaltic lava flows, have occurred since the 17th century. Only six eruptions, in 1708, 1774, 1776, 1800, 1977, and 1986, have originated from fissures outside the scarps.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Pitons, Cirques et Remparts de I'ile de la Reunion, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

It rises to within 650 m of the ocean surface and has a 2-km-wide summit caldera that is 200 m deep. Rift zones that extend to the SE and N give it an arcuate shape. A basaltic volcano, it lies along the axis of the Southeast Indian Ridge and marks the site of the Amsterdam-St. Paul hotspot. This hotspot may have been the source of the Ninetyeast Ridge submarine volcanoes on the Australian Plate prior to its \"capture\" by the Southeast Indian Ridge, after which volcanism was restricted to the Antarctic Plate. Very short half-life radionuclide dating of fresh volcanic glass samples recovered during the 1996 expedition indicated that it had erupted only about 5 months earlier (Johnson et al., 2000). Water column temperature anomalies above the seamount suggest the presence of hydrothermal activity within the caldera.",

Minor late-stage eruptions formed more than two dozen scoria cones and many small lava flows.

The largest island, McDonald, is composed of a layered phonolitic tuff plateau cut by phonolitic dikes and lava domes. A possible nearby active submarine center was inferred from phonolitic pumice that washed up on Heard Island in 1992. Volcanic plumes were observed in December 1996 and January 1997 from McDonald Island. During March 1997 the crew of a vessel that sailed near the island noted vigorous steaming from a vent on the N side of the island along with possible pyroclastic deposits and lava flows. A satellite image taken in November 2001 showed the island to have more than doubled in area since previous reported observations in November 2000. The high point of the island group had shifted to the McDonald's N end, which had merged with Flat Island.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Heard and McDonald Islands, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The stratovolcano was formed during at least five stages dating back to the Miocene. The eruption of plateau basalts from a rift system during stage IV was followed by a glacial period and then by the eruption of scoria cones and lava flows. The young scoria cones are of probable Holocene age and are distributed over much of the island, concentrated at the structural center on the W side and along a series of N-S and NE-trending fractures.

The most recent eruption produced explosive activity and lava flows from four scoria cones at Te Puke about 1,300-1,800 years ago, although the precise date of the activity remains uncertain. Hot springs occur at three locations, including near Lake Omapere, which was dammed by lava flows.",

Fifty-three volcanic centers, comprised of maars, tuff rings, small lava shields, and scoria cones, are within an elliptical zone ~30 km long (N-S) and ~20 km wide (E-W) (Hopkins et al., 2017; Hopkins and Smid, et al., 2020). The first eruptions in the field began about 193,000 years ago, but over half of the volcanoes formed in the past 60,000 years, and there are 19 known eruptions within the last 20,000 years; only Rangitoto has been active during the Holocene (Needham et al., 2011; Hopkins et al., 2017).

A 3-km-wide composite caldera was formed in two or three collapse events, the last of which took place about 6300 years ago, and was accompanied by a Plinian eruption that produced tephra deposits up to 70 cm thick on mainland North Island. Post-caldera eruptions generated a series of lava domes and flows emplaced from NNE-trending vents within the caldera that have filled it to depths of at least 180 m. The latest eruption of Mayor Island has not been dated, but was considered by Houghton et al. (1992) to have occurred perhaps only 500-1000 years ago.",

The island consists of two overlapping andesitic-to-dacitic stratovolcanoes. The SE side of the crater is open at sea level, with the recent activity centered about 1 km from the shore close to the rear crater wall. Volckner Rocks, sea stacks that are remnants of a lava dome, lie 5 km NW. Descriptions of volcanism since 1826 have included intermittent moderate phreatic, phreatomagmatic, and Strombolian eruptions; activity there also forms a prominent part of Maori legends. The formation of many new vents during the 19th and 20th centuries caused rapid changes in crater floor topography. Collapse of the crater wall in 1914 produced a debris avalanche that buried buildings and workers at a sulfur-mining project. Explosive activity in December 2019 took place while tourists were present, resulting in many fatalities. The official government name Whakaari/White Island is a combination of the full Maori name of Te Puia o Whakaari (\"The Dramatic Volcano\") and White Island (referencing the constant steam plume) given by Captain James Cook in 1769.",

Lava domes of the Haroharo complex, at the northern end of the Okataina Volcanic Centre, occupy part of the 16 x 26 km Pleistocene Haroharo caldera, which formed incrementally between 300,000 and 50,000 years before present (BP). The oldest exposed rocks on the caldera floor are about 22,000 years old. The Tarawera complex at the southern end of Okataina consists of 11 rhyolitic lava domes and associated lava flows. The oldest domes were formed as late as about 15,000 years BP, and the youngest were formed in the Kaharoa eruption about 800 years BP. The NE-SW Tarawera vent lineation extends from the two dacitic cones of Maungaongaonga and Mangakakaramea on the SW to Mount Edgecumbe on the NE. Construction of the Haroharo and Tarawera complexes impounded lakes Rotoiti, Totoehu, Okataina, and Tarawera against the outer margins of the Okataina ring structure. A major hydrothermal area is located at Waimangu; the world-renowned Pink and White Terrace siliceous sinter deposits were destroyed during the major basaltic explosive eruption of 1886.",

This was the largest known eruption at Taupo, producing about 1,170 km3 of tephra. This eruption was preceded during the late Pleistocene by the eruption of a large number of rhyolitic lava domes north of Lake Taupo. Large explosive eruptions have occurred frequently during the Holocene from many vents within Lake Taupo and near its margins. The most recent major eruption took place about 1,800 years BP from at least three vents along a NE-SW-trending fissure centered on the Horomotangi Reefs. This extremely violent eruption was New Zealand's largest during the Holocene and produced the thin but widespread phreatoplinian Taupo Ignimbrite, which covered 20,000 km2 of North Island.",

North Crater stratovolcano is truncated by a broad, shallow crater filled by a solidified lava lake that is cut on the NW side by a small explosion crater. The youngest cone, NgÄuruhoe, is also the highest peak.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Tongariro National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The dominantly andesitic 110 km3 volcanic massif is elongated in a NNE-SSW direction and surrounded by another 100 km3 ring plain of volcaniclastic debris, including the NW-flank Murimoto debris-avalanche deposit. A series of subplinian eruptions took place between about 22,600 and 10,000 years ago, but pyroclastic flows have been infrequent. The broad summait area and flank contain at least six vents active during the Holocene. Frequent mild-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded from the Te Wai Ä-Moe (Crater Lake) vent, and tephra characteristics suggest that the crater lake may have formed as recently as 3,000 years ago. Lahars resulting from phreatic eruptions at the summit crater lake are a hazard to a ski area on the upper flanks and lower river valleys.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Tongariro National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Curtis Island, 500 x 800 m, contains a large fumarolically active crater whose floor is only 10 m above sea level. Reports of possible eruptions probably represent increased thermal activity. Geologic studies have documented 18 m of uplift during the past 200 years, with 7 m occurred between 1929 and 1964 (Doyle et al., 1979). An active submarine magmatic or solfataric vent is believed to exist nearby, but its activity cannot unequivocally be associated with the volcano (Lloyd, 1992).",

The 2-km-diameter island consists of a low, gently sloping surface of rhyolitic pumice from the caldera-forming eruption truncated by steep cliffs formed of underlying basaltic lava flows. The pre-caldera edifice consisted of two generations of shield volcanoes separated by a period of pyroclastic cone growth. Eruption of the voluminous Sandy Bay Tuff about 6,300 years ago truncated the NW side of the Annexation shield volcano and formed a 12-km-wide, 1.1-km deep caldera. Following formation of the caldera and substantial marine erosion, a partly submarine and partly subaerial eruption centered about 2 km N of present-day Macauley Island produced basaltic scoriae and lava flows. A reported possible eruption in 1825 from \"Brimstone Island,\" 45 km W of Macauley at a location with a depth of about 2,000 m and SW of Giggenbach submarine volcano, is likely a location error and could refer to an eruption from the submarine flank of Macauley caldera (Lloyd et al., 1996).",

Its long axis is parallel to the tectonic fabric of the Havre Trough that lies W of the volcanic arc. Historical eruptions during the 19th and 20th centuries have sometimes occurred simultaneously from both calderas, and have consisted of small-to-moderate phreatic eruptions, some of which formed ephemeral islands in Denham caldera. An unnamed submarine cone, one of several located along a fissure on the lower NNE flank, has also erupted during historical time, and satellitic vents are concentrated along two parallel NNE-trending lineaments.",

Small parasitic cones occur on the N and W flanks, and an 8.5 x 11 km submarine caldera with a depth of more than 1,500 m lies to the NNE. Numerous eruptions have been identified using submarine acoustic signals since it was first recognized as a volcano in 1977. A shoal that had been reported in 1944 may have been a pumice raft or water disturbance due to degassing. Surface observations have included water discoloration, vigorous gas bubbling, and areas of upwelling water, sometimes accompanied by rumbling noises.

A second eruption from this area was reported in late 1932.

        "geologicalSummary": "The small andesitic islands of Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai are part of the western and northern remnants of the rim (~6 km diameter) of a largely submarine caldera located about 30 km SSE of Falcon Island. The topmost sequence of welded and unwelded ignimbrite units from a caldera-forming eruption was 14C dated to 1040-1180 CE (Cronin et al., 2017; Brenna et al. 2022). At least two additional welded pumice-rich ignimbrite units and nonwelded pyroclastic flow deposits, below paleosols and other volcaniclastic deposits, indicated more very large previous eruptions (Cronin et al., 2017; Brenna et al. 2022). Several submarine eruptions have occurred at this caldera system since the first recorded eruption in 1912, including 1937 and S of the islands in 1988. A short eruption in 2009 added land to to Hunga Ha'apai. At that time the two islands were each about 2 km long, displaying inward-facing sea cliffs with lava and tephra layers dipping gently away from the caldera. An eruption during December 2014-January 2015 was centered between the islands, and combined them into one larger structure. Major explosive eruptions in late 2021 initially reshaped the central part of the combined island before stronger activity in mid-January 2022 removed most of the 2014-15 material; an even larger eruption the next day sent an eruption plume high into the stratosphere, triggered shock waves through the atmosphere and tsunami across the Pacific Ocean, and left only small remnants of the islands above the ocean surface.",

The volcano is in the rear arc of the Tonga-Kermadec Arc System, ~40 km W of the chain of edifices that define the volcanic front, and 25 km E of the central ridge of the Northeast Lau Spreading Center. The composition of the cone and surrounding floor is predominantly dacite. Towing with sea floor cameras over the cone and various parts of the caldera in 2012 resulted in the discovery of at least three sources of hydrothermal particle venting on the cone's summit and adjacent to the inner caldera walls. The Tonga Ministry of Lands, Environment, Climate Change and Natural Resources named the volcano Niuatahi, which means 'sea' in Tongan, with the small cone of Motutahi meaning 'island in the sea.'",

Located about one-third of the way between Ta'u and Rose islands at the E end of the American Samoas, it is considered to mark the current location of the Samoan hotspot. The summit contains an oval-shaped crater that is 2 km wide and 400 m deep. Two principal rift zones extend E and W from the summit, parallel to the trend of the hotspot; a third rift extends SE. The rift zones and escarpments produced by mass wasting phenomena give the seamount a star-shaped pattern. On 10 July 1973 explosions were recorded by SOFAR (hydrophone records of underwater acoustic signals). An earthquake swarm in 1995 may have been related to an eruption. Eruptive activity between April 2001 and April 2005 formed a cone almost 300 m high, named Nafanua. Repeated bathymetric mapping surveys showed depth changes, including height and width increases of Nafanua after 2005, that suggest at least intermittent activity during 1999-2017; a 2019 survey showed no further changes since 2017.",

Steep cliffs up to 600-m high truncate the northern and southern sides of the islands. The narrow, steep-sided ridge forming the eastern tip of Ofu Island consists of a dike complex. The shield volcano on Ofu is cut on the north by the A'ofa caldera; bathymetry suggests that a caldera may also exist on the Sili shield volcano of Olosega. The Nu'utele tuff cone, forming a small crescent-shaped island immediately off the west end of Ofu Island, is Holocene in age. A submarine eruption took place in 1866 at the opposite end of the two islands, 3 km SE of Olosega, along the ridge connecting Olosega with Ta'u Island.",

The caldera is now partially filled by cinder cones and trachytic lava domes. ENE-trending dike complexes are prominently exposed on Pago volcano. Following a lengthy period of erosion, submergence, and the construction of a barrier reef, the Leone Volcanics were erupted during the Holocene along a 5-km-long N-S-trending fissure over a broad area at the southernmost part of the island (Stearns, 1944), forming a group of initially submarine tuff cones and subsequent subaerial cinder cones that produced fresh-looking pahoehoe lava flows. An ash layer overlying a cultural deposit in the SW part of the island was radiocarbon dated at about 440 Â± 200 CE (Addison et al., 2006).",

The most extensive activity during the Pleistocene took place along a 20-km segment along the central axis of the island. Following a lengthy period of erosion, the latest lava flows, at least three of which were estimated to be as young as a few hundred to a few thousand years old, were erupted from vents near the crest of the island at its center and western side (Stearns, 1944). One of the youngest flows reached the north-central coast along a roughly 1.5-km-wide front east of Vailele Bay, and another traveled down the Lefaga River channel and reached the SW coast at Lefaga Bay. Apolima Island off the western tip of Upolu is a Holocene tuff cone too young to be fringed by a coral reef, and other reef-free areas along the coastline may be formed by Holocene lava flows.",

Pliocene and Pleistocene shield formation was followed by stream and marine erosion, partial submergence, and growth of coral reefs. Late-stage Pleistocene and Holocene eruptions produced voluminous lava flows that partially buried fringing reefs. Numerous cinder cones and lava cones dot the broad crest of Savai'i, which has a low-angle, dome-like profile and reaches an elevation of 1858 m. Additional cones occur on the north-central flank, and a large number are found in the south-central part of the island. Three eruptions, including two in the 20th century, occurred in historical time, and produced voluminous lava flows that reached the northern coast along broad fronts up to about 15 km wide, destroying several villages and overtopping fringing reefs.",

A few cones in the central part occur to the west of the axial rift zone. At least 58 eruptions have occurred since the first known human settlements around 950-750 BCE; all of these eruptions affected the southern two-thirds of the island. A period of voluminous eruptions between about 300 and 500 CE caused abandonment of the southern part the island until about 1100 CE.

Five small satellitic centers are located near the island's shoreline on the northern, southern, and western sides. Two summit craters are present; both are active, although most observed eruptions have originated from the southern crater, concentrating eruptive products during much of the past century into the SE valley. Frequent eruptions, typically of mild-to-moderate scale, have been recorded since 1616. Occasional larger eruptions have produced pyroclastic flows and lava flows that reached flat-lying coastal areas and entered the sea, sometimes impacting populated areas.",

The latter was one of the largest historical eruptions in Papua New Guinea and deposited andesitic tephra across the New Guinea highlands, prompting legends of a \"Time of Darkness.\" Post-caldera eruptions have constructed a small cone, Motmot Island, in the south-central part of Lake Wisdom. Moderate explosive eruptions have occurred during the 20th century from vents at and near Motmot Island.",

Two vertical fault-bounded blocks form topographic highs at the western and eastern sides of the caldera. A N-S line of post-caldera cones, explosion craters, and part of an arcuate inner caldera rim form a large peninsula that nearly bisects the arcuate caldera lake. The peninsula includes the 350-m-high andesitic Mount Makalia stratovolcano, the largest of the post-caldera cones, which last erupted during the late-19th century. A major submarine debris avalanche deposit NE of the volcano may represent edifice collapse prior to caldera formation. Thermal areas occur at several locations along the central peninsula.",

The forested andesitic cone has a well-preserved, 400-m-wide crater with a 100-m-high eastern wall and a low western rim. Three large explosion craters occupy the NE flank. The most recent lava flow issued from the summit crater and flowed to the west. This viscous flow is at least 50 m thick, leaving an irregularity in the profile of the volcano. The pristine summit crater and weak fumarolic activity suggested to Lowder and Carmichael (1970) that the most recent eruption may have been only a few hundred years ago.",

The volcano, also known as the Father, rises above the N coast of the island of New Britain across a low saddle NE of Bamus volcano, the South Son. The upper 1,000 m is unvegetated. A prominent E-W escarpment on the south may be the result of large-scale slumping. Satellitic cones occupy the NW and E flanks. A steep-walled valley cuts the NW side, and a flank lava-flow complex lies to the south of this valley. Historical eruptions date back to the beginning of the 18th century. Twentieth-century eruptions were mildly explosive until 1967, but after 1970 several larger eruptions produced lava flows and basaltic pyroclastic flows, greatly modifying the summit crater.",

The 8 x 14 km caldera is widely breached on the east, where its floor is flooded by Blanche Bay and was formed about 1,400 years ago. An earlier caldera-forming eruption about 7,100 years ago is thought to have originated from Tavui caldera, offshore to the north. Three small stratovolcanoes lie outside the N and NE caldera rims. Post-caldera eruptions built basaltic-to-dacitic pyroclastic cones on the caldera floor near the NE and W caldera walls. Several of these, including Vulcan cone, which was formed during a large eruption in 1878, have produced major explosive activity during historical time. A powerful explosive eruption in 1994 occurred simultaneously from Vulcan and Tavurvur volcanoes and forced the temporary abandonment of Rabaul city.",

The SW wall of the roughly 10 x 12 km caldera cuts the NE end of the peninsula and extends from Tavui Point at the northern tip of the peninsula SE to Laweo Point. The 7,100-year-old Raluan Ignimbrite, initially thought to have originated from Rabaul, is now thought to have been produced by an eruption of Tavui. A basaltic scoria layer immediately underlies the rhyolitic ignimbrite, and the introduction of basaltic magma was considered to have triggered the rhyolitic eruption. The lack of a major low-velocity region detectable beneath the caldera during a seismic tomography survey suggests that it is not currently active.",

The 2210-m NW-most volcano, Mount Takuan, is the highest of the group and is a lava cone that has fed viscous lavas flows to the south, similar to those at Bagana volcano.

Grover (1955) noted native accounts of the explosive enlargement of the Ngusunu explosion crater along the SW coast of the island one to two generations prior to 1955, probably after a visit by Guppy in 1882.

Pyroclastic flows and mudflows traveled down valleys from the summit crater to form debris fans along the coast. Thermal areas located in the summit crater, the south to SE flanks, and offshore include areas of steaming ground, fumaroles, small geysers, and hot springs. Spanish explorers arrived in 1568 during the first historical eruption of Savo. Pyroclastic flows during the climactic phase killed almost all inhabitants of the island, and oral traditions also note the expansion of the island on the northern side.

In about 1840, an explosive eruption apparently produced pyroclastic flows that swept all sides of the island, killing its inhabitants. Recorded eruptions have frequently originated from a cone constructed within the large breached crater. These have left the upper flanks and the steep apron of lava flows and volcaniclastic debris within the breach unvegetated.",

A thick, almost exclusively pyroclastic sequence, initially dacitic then basaltic, overlies lava flows of a pre-caldera shield volcano. The caldera was formed during a major Plinian eruption with dacitic pyroclastic flows about 1,900 years ago. Post-caldera eruptions, primarily from Marum and Benbow cones, have partially filled the caldera floor and produced lava flows that ponded on the floor or overflowed through gaps in the caldera rim. Post-caldera eruptions have also formed a series of scoria cones and maars along a fissure system oriented ENE-WSW. Eruptions have apparently occurred almost yearly during historical time from cones within the caldera or from flank vents. However, from 1850 to 1950, reporting was mostly limited to extra-caldera eruptions that would have affected local populations.",

The basaltic-to-andesitic volcano has been active during historical time at both summit and flank vents, primarily along a NW-SE-trending fissure that cuts across the island, producing moderate explosive eruptions and lava flows that reached the coast. Historical eruptions at the 1413-m-high volcano date back to the mid-19th century. The island was evacuated following major eruptions in 1939 and 1960. The latter eruption, from a NW-flank fissure vent, produced a pyroclastic flow that swept to the sea and a lava flow that formed a new peninsula on the western coast.",

(2018) suggest an alternate to the post-caldera formation model. A few smaller cones are south of Epi B. Ephemeral islands were formed during eruptions at Epi B in 1920 and 1953. Explosive activity was reported in 1958 and 1960, discolored water was often seen during 1971-1974 and 1988, a new vent was detected in 1979, and explosive activity occurred in 1999, 2002, 2004, and 2023. The summit was at 34 m below sea level at the time of a 2001 survey, and a research cruise in 2013 (R/V Sonne SO-229; Haase et al, 2013) sampled six cones, including \"very fresh pumice and lava bombs\" from Epi B and \"relatively old-looking\" material from the others. The SO-229 cruise also recovered rhyodacitic pumice with mafic streaks, similar to that sampled by previous cruises, and described Epi B as \"covered by massive blocks of pumice.\"",

Several vents were active during the Holocene; another vent (Mount Tower) is now considered to be of late-Pleistocene age. Late-Pleistocene to Holocene eruptions are characterized by small volume and low explosivity. The youngest dated eruptions took place at Mount Schank and Mount Gambier about 5,000 years ago, when explosive activity formed several maars and associated lava flows.",

Rock et al. (1982) found no evidence for historical eruptions.

The latest of these produced the Young Toba Tuff (YTT) about 74,000 years ago from vents at the NW and SE ends of present-day Lake Toba. The YTT represents the largest known Quaternary eruption, ejecting about 3,800 km3 (dense rock equivalent) of ash that covered ~40 million km2 to a depth greater than 5 mm, plus another 1,500 km3 of pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits (Costa et al., 2014). Resurgent doming formed the massive Samosir Island and Uluan Peninsula structural blocks after the YTT eruption. Additional post-YTT eruptions include emplacement of a series of lava domes, growth of the solfatarically active Pusukbukit volcano on the south margin of the caldera, and formation of Tandukbenua volcano at the NW-most rim of the caldera. Lack of vegetation suggests that Tandukbenua may be only a few hundred years old (Chesner and Rose, 1991).",

Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan, and left only a remnant of Rakata. This eruption caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java. Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former Danan and Perbuwatan cones. Anak Krakatau has been the site of frequent eruptions since 1927.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Ujung Kulon National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Younger pyroclastics from Gunung Putri-Eweranda overlap the Talagabodas products in the north. The crater of Talagabodas has shifted 1.3 km north from the summit crater of Canar and contains a large sulfur-saturated lake. Fumaroles, mud pots, and a warm spring are found around the lake, which has an elevated temperature. The age of the most recent eruption is not known. Changes in lake color occurred in 1913 and 1921, and expanded solfataric activity was reported in 1927. Suffocating gases have frequently killed animals that have wandered into the Pajagalan valley on the NE flank and the Kawah Saat geothermal area south of the crater lake. The Kawah Karaha fumaroles 9 km N are also part of the geothermal system (Tripp et al., 2002).",

A cluster of summit lava domes cut by numerous craters has given the summit a very irregular profile. Satellitic cones and lava domes are also located low on the E, W, and SSW flanks. Eruptive activity has in general migrated in a clockwise direction around the summit vent complex. More than 30 eruptions have been recorded since 1000 CE. The ejection of water from the crater lake during the typically short but violent eruptions has created pyroclastic flows and lahars that have caused widespread fatalities and destruction. After more than 5,000 people were killed during an eruption in 1919, an engineering project to drain the crater lake lowered the surface by more than 50 m. The 1951 eruption deepened the crater by 70 m, leaving 50 million cubic meters of water after the damaged drainage tunnels were repaired. Following more than 200 deaths in the 1966 eruption, a new deeper tunnel was constructed, and the lake's volume before the 1990 eruption was only about 1 million cubic meters.",

Summit topography is complicated by the shifting of craters from NW to SE. Frequent 19th and 20th century eruptions were dominated by small-to-moderate explosions from the summit crater, with occasional lava flows and larger explosive eruptions accompanied by pyroclastic flows that have reached the lower flanks of the volcano.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Bromo Tengger Semeru-Arjuno, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

Immediately west of the Gunung Merapi stratovolcano is the historically active Kawah Ijen crater, which contains a nearly 1-km-wide, turquoise-colored, acid lake. Kawah Ijen is the site of a labor-intensive mining operation in which baskets of sulfur are hand-carried from the crater floor. Many other post-caldera cones and craters are located within the caldera or along its rim. The largest concentration of cones forms an E-W zone across the southern side of the caldera. Coffee plantations cover much of the caldera floor; nearby waterfalls and hot springs are tourist destinations.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Beleambanga, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The cones are well-formed, but covered with thick soils and vegetation; they are thought to have been inactive for hundreds or thousands of years (Wheller, 1986). The Tapak and Lesong cones are not covered by deposits of the youngest dacitic pumice eruptions of nearby Batur volcano, and are thus thought to be less than 23,000 years old. The geothermal field within the caldera has been developed to produce electrical power, and hot springs are located in more than a dozen locations.",

The inner 6.4 x 9.4 km caldera was formed about 20,150 years ago during eruption of the Gunungkawi Ignimbrite. The SE wall of the inner caldera lies beneath Lake Batur; Batur cone has been constructed within the inner caldera to a height above the outer caldera rim. The Batur stratovolcano has produced vents over much of the inner caldera, but a NE-SW fissure system has localized the Batur I, II, and III craters along the summit ridge. Recorded eruptions have been characterized by mild-to-moderate explosive activity sometimes accompanied by lava emission. Basaltic lava flows from both summit and flank vents have reached the caldera floor and the shores of Lake Batur in historical time.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Batur, a UNESCO Global Geopark property.",

The largely trachybasaltic-to-trachyandesitic volcano grew to about 4,000 m elevation before forming a caldera more than 43,000 years ago. Late-Pleistocene lava flows largely filled the early caldera, after which activity changed to dominantly explosive eruptions during the early Holocene. Tambora was the source of history's largest explosive eruption, in April 1815. Pyroclastic flows reached the sea on all sides of the peninsula, and heavy tephra fall devastated croplands, causing an estimated 60,000 fatalities. The eruption of an estimated more than 150 km3 of tephra formed a 6-km-wide, 1250-m-deep caldera and produced global climatic effects. Minor lava domes and flows have been extruded on the caldera floor at Tambora during the 19th and 20th centuries.",

Three cones, progressively younger to the north, form the summit. Several maars and vents define a rift zone, parallel to the Halmahera island arc, that cuts the volcano; the S-flank Ngade maar formed after about 14,500â13,000 cal. BP (Faral et al., 2022). Eruptions, recorded frequently since the 16th century, typically originated from the summit craters, although flank eruptions have occurred in 1763, 1770, 1775, and 1962-63.",

PHIVOLCS at one time listed eruptions in 1866 and 1867, but had removed those eruptions as of 2020. A strong earthquake swarm occurred nearby in 1976.",

The youngest volcano, and the only historically active one, is Hibok-Hibok (also known as Catarman). It lies at the NW end of the island, about 6 km NW of Mt. Mambajao. This andesitic-to-rhyolitic volcano contains several lava domes, including Mt. Vulcan on its NW flank. Major eruptions during 1871-75 and 1948-53 formed flank lava domes at Hibok-Hibok and produced pyroclastic flows that devastated coastal villages.",

Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel far down the flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the approximately 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often damaged populated lowland areas.

A large breached crater open to the SE was formed as a result of a major debris avalanche that buried several villages and formed a broad hummocky deposit across the plain south of Lake Buhi. This catastrophic event was at one time considered to have occurred during 1628 CE, but later work has shown that the collapse occurred earlier at some unknown date during the Holocene. An older debris avalanche deposit of similar size was also described SW of the volcano (Paguican et al., 2010). Both debris avalanche deposits cover wide areas of low, waterlogged plains, to a distance of ~16 km for the older and 12 km for the younger. The collapse orientation and deposit constituents for both are consistent with being a response to transtensional faulting and gravity spreading. A cone and lava covering about 9 km2 post-date the younger collapse.",

The youthfule morphology of the San Cristobal stratovolcano suggests that it postdates Banahaw. Banahaw de Lucban stratovolcano was constructed within the 8-km-wide amphitheater related to the two debris avalanches, and is the youngest volcano of the Banahaw complex. The 2-km-wide, 600-m-deep summit crater of Banahaw is open to the SSW and contained a crater lake until 1730, when it drained, forming mudflows. Mudflows were also recorded in 1743?, 1843 and 1909, possibly also associated with explosive activity.",

Caldera formation lowered the height of the summit by more than 300 m. Although the eruption caused hundreds of fatalities and major damage with severe social and economic impact, successful monitoring efforts greatly reduced the number of fatalities. Widespread lahars that redistributed products of the 1991 eruption have continued to cause severe disruption. Previous major eruptive periods, interrupted by lengthy quiescent periods, have produced pyroclastic flows and lahars that were even more extensive than in 1991.",

Additional submarine cones occur between Ile des Cendres and the Vietnam mainland (Bondarenko and Nadezhnyi, 1989). In 1880 there was a reef (named Veteran) reported about 36 km S, described as being 34 km SSE of Grand Catwick Rock (Round Island). It was not found in 1882, but was attributed to a possible volcanic eruption (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World), and discolored water was reported in 1928.",

A 1.6-km-wide, 850-m-deep crater is widely breached to the NW as a result of slope failure. A debris avalanche deposit (3 km3) covers an area of 27 km2 N of the breach. The pyroclastic flow and debris avalanche deposits overlie a paleosol 14C dated around 8,500 cal BP, so Belousov et al. (2018) placed the last eruption at approximately 8,000 cal BP. Local legends describe \"a great earthquake\" when the cone of Popa \"rose from the plains\" in 442 BCE (Belousov et al., 2018, citing Bell, 1907), but there is no physical evidence of an eruption that recent. The steep Taung Kalat lava plug on the WSW flank is famous for the monastery built on top.",

The youngest volcanism in the 600 km2 field occurred in two stages during the early and late Holocene. Volcanic cones at the northern end of the field are sparsely vegetated and have clearly visible lava flows. Three basaltic-andesite centers, Dayinshshan, Maanshan, and possibly Heikongshan, are of Holocene age. An unconfirmed explosive eruption took place in 1609 CE, and there are unconfirmed reports of eruptions during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911 CE).

One of Japan's most frequently active volcanoes, it was in a state of intermittent Strombolian activity from Otake, the NE summit crater, between 1949 and 1996, after which periods of inactivity lengthened. The largest recorded eruption took place in 1813-14, when thick scoria deposits blanketed residential areas, and the SW crater produced two lava flows that reached the western coast. At the end of the eruption the summit of Otake collapsed, forming a large debris avalanche and creating the open Sakuchi caldera, which extends to the eastern coast. The island remained uninhabited for about 70 years after the 1813-1814 eruption. Lava flows reached the eastern coast of the island in 1884. Only about 50 people live on the island.",

The eruption devastated southern and central Kyushu, which remained uninhabited for several centuries. Post-caldera eruptions formed Iodake (or Iwo-dake) lava dome and Inamuradake scoria cone, as well as submarine lava domes. Recorded eruptions have occurred at or near Satsuma-Iojima (also known as Tokara-Iojima), a small 3 x 6 km island forming part of the NW caldera rim. Showa-Iojima lava dome (also known as Iojima-Shinto), a small island 2 km E of Satsuma-Iojima, was formed during submarine eruptions in 1934 and 1935.

That area consists of numerous central cones and maars, the 4.5-km-wide Ikeda caldera, and Kaimondake stratovolcano. The symmetrical andesitic Kaimondake is the most prominent feature, and is capped by a lava dome. Ibusuki has been very active during the Holocene, forming the Ikeda caldera about 4,600 years ago, numerous maars and lava domes. Kaimondake formed during the last 4,000 years, from which all eruptive activity has occurred after about 2,650 years ago. Its last eruption took place in the 9th century. While listed as features of the Ata caldera, JMA (2013) simultaneously listed Kaimondake and the combination of Ikeda and Yamagawa as distinct volcanoes.",

The construction of Sakurajima began about 13,000 years ago on the southern rim and built an island that was joined to the Osumi Peninsula during the major explosive and effusive eruption of 1914. Activity at the Kitadake summit cone ended about 4,850 years ago, after which eruptions took place at Minamidake. Frequent eruptions since the 8th century have deposited ash on the city of Kagoshima, located across Kagoshima Bay only 8 km from the summit.

Two large lava domes, Tsurumidake and Yufudake (the highest at 1,584 m), are located at the east and west sides of the complex, respectively. Three smaller lava domes are on the N flank of Tsurumidake, including Garandake. The latest activity at both the andesitic-to-dacitic Tsurumi and Yufu groups postdates the 6,300-year-old Akahoya ash from Kikai volcano. Pyroclastic flows dominated during older eruptions, whereas lava domes and lava flows are most common in more recent eruptions. An eruption about 2,200 years ago from Yufudake began with collapse of the N flank that produced a debris avalanche and was followed by lava dome growth and associated pyroclastic flows. The most recent known eruption was from Tsurumi in 867 CE, when there was explosive activity from the summit area. The colorful hot spring pools and mudpots of Beppu along the coast are a noted thermal area.",

An earlier phase of activity at the dominantly Pleistocene Abu volcano group during the late-Pliocene to early Pleistocene was followed by renewed activity about 800,000 years ago that continued into the Holocene.

These volcanoes are located on a basement of late-Tertiary volcanic rocks and related sediments and on the flanks of three Quaternary stratovolcanoes: Amagi, Tenshi, and Usami. Some eruptive vents are controlled by fissure systems trending NW-SE or NE-SW. Thirteen eruptive episodes have been documented during the past 32,000 years.

Dome growth occurred progressively to the NW, and the largest and youngest of these, Kamiyama, forms the high point. The calderas are breached to the east by the Hayakawa canyon. A phreatic explosion about 3000 years ago was followed by collapse of the NW side of Kamiyama, damming the Hayakawa valley and creating Lake Ashi. The latest magmatic eruptive activity about 2900 years ago produced a pyroclastic flow and a lava dome in the explosion crater, although phreatic eruptions took place as recently as the 12-13th centuries CE. Seismic swarms have occurred during the 20th century. Lake Ashi, along with the thermal areas in the caldera, is a popular resort destination SW of Tokyo.",

Growth of the Younger Fuji volcano began with a period of voluminous lava flows from 11,000 to 8000 years before present (BP), accounting for four-fifths of the volume of the Younger Fuji volcano. Minor explosive eruptions dominated activity from 8000 to 4500 BP, with another period of major lava flows occurring from 4500 to 3000 BP. Subsequently, intermittent major explosive eruptions occurred, with subordinate lava flows and small pyroclastic flows. Summit eruptions dominated from 3000 to 2000 BP, after which flank vents were active. The extensive basaltic lava flows from the summit and some of the more than 100 flank cones and vents blocked drainages against the Tertiary Misaka Mountains on the north side of the volcano, forming the Fuji Five Lakes, popular resort destinations. The last confirmed eruption of this dominantly basaltic volcano in 1707 was Fuji's largest during historical time. It deposited ash on Edo (Tokyo) and formed a large new crater on the east flank.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Fujisan, sacred place and source of artistic inspiration, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The basaltic-to-dacitic Kita Yatsugatake group also contains the Tateshinayama, Shimagareyama, Chausuyama and Futagomine volcanoes. Tateshinayama is sometimes known as Suwa Fuji because of its conical profile. A large lava flow forms the Tateshina-kogen plateau south of Tateshinayama and Yokodake. A debris avalanche from edifice collapse in 888 CE created Matsubara Lake on the east side of the massif.",

Ascending this volcano is one of the major objects of religious pilgrimage in central Japan.

The older volcanic complex consisted of at least four major stratovolcanoes constructed from about 680,000 to about 420,000 years ago, after which Ontakesan was inactive for more than 300,000 years. The broad, elongated summit of the younger edifice is cut by a series of small explosion craters along a NNE-trending line. Several phreatic eruptions post-date the roughly 7300-year-old Akahoya tephra from Kikai caldera. The first historical eruption took place in 1979 from fissures near the summit. A non-eruptive landslide in 1984 produced a debris avalanche and lahar that swept down valleys south and east of the volcano. Very minor phreatic activity caused a dusting of ash near the summit in 1991 and 2007. A significant phreatic explosion in September 2014, when a large number of hikers were at or near the summit, resulted in many fatalities.",

The volcano was constructed on a base of Tertiary mountains beginning about 3,100 years ago. Three major eruptions in the past 1,000 years have produced pyroclastic flows and lava flows that traveled mainly down the Hayakawa river valley to the N and NW. The first of these eruptions, in 887 CE (and possibly 989 CE), produced the Hayakawa pyroclastic flow, which reached the coast, and the massive Mae-yama lava flow, which traveled about 6.5 km down the Hayakawa river valley. The summit lava dome was emplaced during the 1361 CE eruption, and the last magmatic eruption took place in 1773 CE. Eruptive activity since 1773 has consisted of relatively minor phreatic explosions from several radial fissures and explosion craters that cut the summit and flanks of the dome.",

It was constructed during four stages beginning about 300,000 years ago, each evolving from basaltic to andesitic and dacitic eruptions. The latest eruptive stage began about 43,000 years ago. Several episodes of edifice collapse during the late Pleistocene to early Holocene have produced major debris avalanches that traveled to the east and NE. Pyroclastic flows traveled down the eastern flanks during the mid-Holocene about 5800 and 4200 years ago, and the latest dated eruption produced pyroclastic surges about 2800-2500 years ago. No historical eruptions are known at Myokosan, but constant solfataric activity occurs between the dome and the south caldera wall at a place where sulfur was once mined.",

Growth of a dacitic shield volcano was accompanied by pumiceous pyroclastic flows, the largest of which occurred about 14,000-11,000 BP, and by growth of the Ko-Asamayama lava dome on the east flank. Maekake, capped by the Kamayama pyroclastic cone that forms the present summit, is probably only a few thousand years old and has observed activity dating back at least to the 11th century CE. Maekake has had several major Plinian eruptions, the last two of which occurred in 1108 (Asamayama's largest Holocene eruption) and 1783 CE.",

Historical eruptions have consisted of phreatic explosions from the acidic crater lakes or their margins. Fumaroles and hot springs that dot the flanks have strongly acidified many rivers draining from the volcano. The crater was the site of active sulfur mining for many years during the 19th and 20th centuries.",

Eruptions along this fissure initially produced the phreatic Takahara-Uenohara tephra deposit, which was distributed primarily to the east. The symmetrical Fujiyama lava dome, one of many conical volcanoes named after Japan's renowned Mount Fuji, was extruded at the end of the eruption.",

Activity during the last 55,000 years included the collapse of Asahidake volcano about 30-40,000 years ago producing the massive Ofujisan debris-avalanche deposit, which blankets a broad area SE of the volcano. The youngest volcano, Chausudake, began forming about 16,000 years ago. Six magmatic eruptions took place since then, the latest in 1408-1410, when the youngest summit lava dome, Chausudake, was formed. These eruptions produced block-and-ash flows and concluded with the extrusion of lava flows. Smaller phreatic eruptions have occurred every few hundred years during the past 5000 years.",

Construction took place in three main stages that began about 550,000, 350,000, and 200,000 years ago. The high point of the complex is 1728-m-high Minowasan, a dome-shaped stratovolcano north of Tetsuzan, the currently active stratovolcano. Numanotaira, the active summit crater, is surrounded by hot springs and fumaroles and is breached by the Iogawa river (\"Sulfur River\") on the west. Seventy-two workers of a sulfur mine in the summit crater were killed during an eruption in 1900. Historical eruptions have been restricted to the 1.2-km-wide, 350-m-deep Numonotaira crater.",

The dominantly basaltic summit cone of Higashi-Iwate volcano, Yakushidake, is truncated by a 500-m-wide crater. It rises well above and buries the eastern rim of the caldera, which is breached by a narrow gorge on the NW. A central cone containing a 500-m-wide crater partially filled by a lake is located in the center of the oval-shaped caldera. A young lava flow from Yakushidake descended into the caldera, and a fresh-looking lava flow from the 1732 eruption traveled down the NE flank.",

Ninomegata and Sannomegata are located immediately east and south of Toga Bay (Togowan), which itself is a maar. The rim of the rhyolitic Toga (Togowan) maar, larger than the Megata maars, is breached by the sea on the western side and was formed about 450,000 years ago. The Megata maars are mostly late Pleistocene in age, but Murayama (1987) noted that pottery from roughly 4000 years before present (Jomon Period) has been found within tephra layers from the maars.",

Following late-Pleistocene andesitic-to-rhyolitic caldera-forming eruptions, the basaltic Ninokura stratovolcano grew in the SSE section of the caldera. Successive dacitic-to-rhyolitic explosive eruptions from the Goshikiiwa cone led to the formation of the roughly 2-km-wide Nakanoumi caldera, whose SW and NE rims form peninsulas extending into Lake Towada. The andesitic-to-dacitic Ogurayama lava dome was built over the NE rim of Nakanoumi.

Dissected lava domes ring the caldera floor. The andesitic-to-dacitic volcano is largely Pleistocene in age, with activity dating back about 800,000 years. The last identified distal tephra deposit was erupted during the late Pleistocene. The only report of historical activity was in a Tohoku district travel document published in 1787, which stated that Yakeyama in Mutsu country (Osoreyama) had erupted. Older residents reported that large fires and clouds were sometimes seen from the summit, accounting for the volcano's local name, Yakeyama, or \"Burning Mountain\" (Murayama, 1987). Earthquake swarms have been documented during the second half of the 20th century, and magma bodies have been detected beneath the volcano.",

Although it is a dominantly basaltic volcano, strong explosive activity has occurred at intervals of 100-150 years throughout the past few thousand years. A major eruption in 1986 produced spectacular lava fountains up to 1,600 m high and a 16-km-high eruption column; more than 12,000 people were evacuated from the island.",

Frequent historical eruptions have occurred since 1085 CE at vents ranging from the summit to below sea level, causing much damage on this small populated island. After a three-century-long hiatus ending in 1469, activity has been dominated by flank fissure eruptions sometimes accompanied by minor summit eruptions.

The eroded Pleistocene-to-Holocene Higashiyama volcano occupies the SE end of the 14-km-long island, and the symmetrical Holocene Nishiyama volcano the NW end. Parasitic cones occur on the SE flank of Nishiyama. The small volcanic island of Kojima lies several kilometers W of Hachijojima. Growth of Higashiyama began several tens of thousands of years ago, and included the formation of two small calderas. The initial submarine and early subaerial eruptions of Nishiyama took place from 10,000 to 8000 years before present (BP). Its latest major activity, from the early Holocene until about 4,000 BP, was restricted to flank eruptions. Eruptions recorded since the 15th century have been restricted to the summit of Nishiyama and a submarine vent of unknown location.",

Two pyroclastic cones were formed inside the caldera during the latest eruption from 1780 to 1785. Growth of the volcano began with construction of the Kurosaki stratovolcano in the NW part of the island, after which the main stratovolcano began growing in the SE. Both summit and flank vents produced pyroclastic surges and lava flows. Late in the construction of the main cone a 1-1.5 km crater was formed on the SE flank. About 3000 years ago pyroclastic surges swept over the entire island. During about the next 600 years, lava flows and scoria deposits filled the SE crater, which also collapsed repeatedly. The current Ikenosawa crater was considered by Takada et al. (1992) to have formed by ring collapse at the time of a debris avalanche, after which the volcano was quiescent until the eruptions of historical time.",

The high point on the western rim is a pumice-mantled remnant of the pre-collapse volcanic complex that reaches a depth of 360 m. The caldera walls reveal rhyolitic lava flows, shallow intrusions, and volcaniclastic deposits. A voluminous blanket of coarse rhyolitic pumice from the caldera-forming eruption mantles the rim and outer flanks. Post-caldera eruptions formed a lava dome that rises 250 m above the caldera floor. The age of the caldera is not known, but was considered by Fiske et al. (2001) to perhaps be as young as a few thousand years. An active hydrothermal vent field lies on the eastern caldera floor and has produced a polymetallic sulfide deposit from vent chimneys up to 30 m high that emit fluids as hot as 278 degrees C.",

Formation of the 8-9 km wide caldera was followed by construction of a large (2.6 km3) lava dome and/or lava flow complex on the caldera floor, originally located at a depth of 1,000-1,100 m. Most eruptions recorded since the late-19th century have occurred from the dacitic post-caldera Myojinsho lava dome on the NE caldera rim. Deposits from submarine pyroclastic flows associated with growth of the dome cover it and extend both into the NE part of the caldera and down its outer slopes. An explosive submarine eruption from Myojinsho in 1952 destroyed a Japanese research vessel, killing all 31 on board. Submarine eruptions have also been observed from other points on the caldera rim and outside of the caldera. The Beyonesu Rocks were named after the French warship the Bayonnaise, which was surveying volcanic islands south of Tokyo Bay in 1850.",

Two large submarine cones, Sumisu Knolls No. 1 and 2, lie west of the caldera. Submarine eruptions have been reported from a number of locations near Sumisujima, the last of which occurred in 1916. Water discoloration has frequently been observed since the 1970's. In October 1992 a 6-km-long zone of discolored water was seen extending from the shallow Shirane rock mass near the eastern rim of the caldera, which rises to within 7 m of the ocean surface and is the youngest feature of the volcanic complex.",

The triangular, low-elevation, 8-km-long island narrows toward its SW tip and has produced trachyandesitic and trachytic rocks that are more alkalic than those of other volcanoes in this arc. The island has undergone uplift for at least the past 700 years, accompanying resurgent doming of the caldera; a shoreline landed upon by Captain Cook's surveying crew in 1779 is now 40 m above sea level. The Motoyama plateau on the NE half of the island consists of submarine tuffs overlain by coral deposits and forms the island's high point. Many fumaroles are oriented along a NE-SW zone cutting through Motoyama. Numerous recorded phreatic eruptions, many from vents on the W and NW sides of the island, have accompanied the uplift.",

Radiometric dating indicates an age of less than 8,000 years and probably less than 1,000 years; radium/thorium disequilibrium ratios suggest the flows may be only a few centuries old (Fryer et al., 1997).

The caldera has an average submarine depth of about 200 m and contains a twin-peaked central lava dome that rises to within about 20 m of the sea surface. The Maug Islands form a twin volcanic massif with Supply Reef, about 11 km N. The truncated inner walls of the caldera on all three islands expose lava flows and pyroclastic deposits that are cut by radial dikes; bedded ash deposits overlie the outer flanks of the islands. No eruptions are known since the discovery of the islands by Espinosa in 1522. The presence of poorly developed coral reefs and coral on the central lava dome suggests a long period of general quiescence, although it does not exclude mild eruptions (Corwin, 1971).

The latter has three coalescing cones and a breached summit crater that fed lava flows to the west and NW. The 287-m high point of the island is the south rim of the caldera. Freycinet misidentifed Guguan with Alamagan; reported eruptions in 1819 and 1901 (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World) actually refer to solfataric activity on Alamagan (Corwin, 1971). The only known historical eruption of Guguan took place between 1882 and 1884 and produced the northern volcano and lava flows that reached the coast.",

Ponded lava flows overlain by pyroclastic deposits fill the floor of the western caldera, whose SW side is cut by a fresh-looking smaller crater. The 2-km-wide eastern portion of the caldera contained a steep-walled inner crater whose floor prior to the 2003 eruption was only 68 m above sea level. A submarine cone, named NE Anatahan, rises to within 460 m of the sea surface on the NE flank, and numerous other submarine vents are found on the NE-to-SE flanks. Sparseness of vegetation on the most recent lava flows had indicated that they were of Holocene age, but the first historical eruption did not occur until May 2003, when a large explosive eruption took place forming a new crater inside the eastern caldera.",

The western cone failed during an eruption in 1741, creating a large horseshoe-shaped caldera breached to the north that extends from the summit down to the sea floor at the base of the volcano and producing a mostly submarine debris avalanche that traveled 16 km. A tsunami associated with the collapse swept the coasts of Hokkaido, western Honshu, and Korea, and caused nearly 1500 fatalities. The 1741 eruption, the largest in historical time at Oshima-Oshima, concluded with the construction of a basaltic pyroclastic cone at the head of the breached caldera.

Dacitic domes erupted along two NW-SE-trending lines fill and flank the summit caldera. Three of these domes, O-Usu, Ko-Usu and Showashinzan, along with seven crypto-domes, were erupted during historical time. The 1663 eruption of Usu was one of the largest in Hokkaido during historical time. The war-time growth of Showashinzan from 1943-45 was painstakingly documented by the local postmaster, who created the first detailed record of growth of a lava dome.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Toya Caldera and Usu Volcano, a UNESCO Global Geopark property.",

A major dacitic pumice eruption at the end of the 4th stage about 40,000 years ago resulted in the formation of the 3-km-diameter Kuttara caldera. The caldera cut a basaltic-to-andesitic stratovolcano complex, which late in its activity produced two major andesitic lava flows on its north side at Kita-yama. Explosions, probably in early Holocene time, formed two large craters on the west flank of the caldera, and a dacitic lava dome was emplaced about 10,000 years ago. Late-stage phreatic explosion products from Jigoku-dani, a 300-400 m wide crater south of the lava dome, overlie the 1663 tephra from Usu volcano.

Pyroclastic-flow deposits from Tarumaesan extend nearly to the Pacific coast. Two other Holocene post-caldera volcanoes, Fuppushidake (adjacent to Tarumaesan) and Eniwadake (on the opposite side of the caldera), occur on a line trending NW from Tarumaesan, and were constructed just inside the caldera rim. Minor eruptions took place from the summit of Eniwadake as late as the 17th century. The summit of Tarumaesan contains a small 1.5-km-wide caldera formed during two of Hokkaido's largest historical eruptions, in 1667 and 1739. Tarumaesan is now capped by a flat-topped summit lava dome that formed in 1909.",

The Holocene Atosanupuri stratovolcano and lava-dome complex is located near the center of the caldera, east of the crescent-shaped Lake Kutcharo. Many lava domes were formed between about 1000-10,000 years ago. No historical eruptions are known, although intense fumarolic activity occurs on and around Atosanupuri volcano and along the shores of Lake Kutcharo.",

A large explosive eruption about 1,000 years ago, the latest dated eruption, created a 1.2 x 1.5 km crater at the summit of Kamuinupuri. The small island of Kamuishu in the center of Lake Mashu represents the tip of a mostly submerged dacitic lava dome.",

The 1660-m-high volcano is located along a ridge 5 km SW of Shiretoko-Iozan volcano, the NE-most Holocene volcano in Hokkaido. Young lava flows descend the NW flank and broad areas along the SE flank, and an older lava flow traveled about 9 km W, reaching the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk along a broad front. Eruptions produced pumiceous tephras with associated pyroclastic flows about 2200, 1400, and 800 years ago. Recent work has documented a pyroclastic-flow deposit that overlies the 1739 tephra from Tarumai volcano in SW Hokkaido. Stratigraphic relationships place this eruption, the most recent known from Rausudake, between about 1750 and 1850 CE.",
