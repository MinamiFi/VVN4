The smaller, but better known, East Eifel Volcanic Field is about 40 km NE. Individual vents spread across a broad NW-SE-trending area extending about 50 km from the towns of Ormont on the NW to Bad Bertrich on the SE. Eruptions originated from a mantle plume through Devonian sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Two-thirds of the volcanic centers in the field are scoria cones; lava flows have been produced from about half of them. About 30% of the centers are maars or tuff rings, many of which are occupied by lakes. About 230 eruptions have occurred during the past 730,000 years. The latest eruptions formed the Ulmener, Pulvermaar, and Strohn maars around the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Vulkaneifel, a UNESCO Global Geopark property.",

Construction of the present-day Chaîne des Puys began about 70,000 years before present (BP), and was largely completed by the beginning of the Holocene. Holocene eruptions constructed lava domes such as the Puy de Dôme, whose growth was accompanied by pyroclastic flows, cinder cones that fed lengthy lava flows, and maars. The latest well-documented activity took place about 6,000 BP near Besse-en-Chandesse and included the powerful explosions that formed the Lac Pavin maar. The dating of younger tephras has not yet been confirmed, and reports of eruptions as late as 1,000 BP have been discredited.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Chaîne des Puys Limagne Fault Tectonic Arena, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Subsequent eruptions occurred from a new 5-km-wide central cone and from many phreatomagmatic craters and cones within the Artemisio-Tuscolana caldera and on its outer flanks. The post-caldera eruptions have buried the western side of the caldera rim. The largest of the post-caldera craters is Lake Albano, a 2.5 x 4 km compound maar constructed at the WSW margin of the caldera in multiple stages dating back to about 69,000 years ago. The age of the most recent eruptions from the Albano maar is not known precisely; variable dates range from about 36,000 years ago to perhaps the Holocene, when several possibly non-volcanic lake overflow lahars occurred. Reported eruptions during the Roman period are uncertain, but subsequent seismic swarms lasting up to two years have been recorded.",

The historically active cone of Vesuvius was constructed within a large caldera of the ancestral Monte Somma volcano, thought to have formed incrementally beginning about 17,000 years ago. The Monte Somma caldera wall has channeled lava flows and pyroclastic flows primarily to the south and west. Eight major explosive eruptions have taken place in the last 17,000 years, often accompanied by large pyroclastic flows and surges, such as during the well-known 79 CE Pompeii eruption. Intermittent eruptions since 79 CE were followed by a period of frequent long-term explosive and effusive eruptions between 1631 and 1944. The large 1631 eruption produced pyroclastic flows that reached as far as the coast and caused great destruction. Many towns are located on the volcano's flanks, and several million people live within areas that could be affected by eruptions.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Somma Vesuvio and Miglio d'oro, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The eruption of the trachytic Green Tuff ignimbrite about 56,000 years ago was followed by caldera formation. The high point on the island, Monte Epomeo, is a volcanic horst composed of the Green Tuff ignimbrite deposit that was submerged after its eruption and then uplifted. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; at least 800 m of uplift has formed as a result of resurgent doming during past 33,000 years. Many small monogenetic volcanoes were formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous tephras, tuff rings, lava domes, and lava flows, and a major collapse of Mount Epomeo produced a large submarine debris-avalanche deposit. The latest eruption, in 1302 CE, produced a spatter cone and the Arso lava flow, which reached the NE coast.",

The Neostromboli eruptive period took place between about 13,000 and 5,000 years ago. The active summit vents are located at the head of the Sciara del Fuoco, a prominent scarp that formed about 5,000 years ago due to a series of slope failures which extends to below sea level. The modern volcano has been constructed within this scarp, which funnels pyroclastic ejecta and lava flows to the NW. Essentially continuous mild Strombolian explosions, sometimes accompanied by lava flows, have been recorded for more than a millennium.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Isole Eolie (Aeolian Islands), a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

The submerged Secca dei Pesci lava dome lies at the SE end of the platform, and the rhyolitic Basiluzzo lava dome rises 165 m above the surface at the NE end, along a ridge trending towards Stromboli volcano. The complex was constructed in two main stages: an initial effusive activity phase that produced lava domes, and an explosive stage. The youngest subaerial airfall-tephra deposits are dated to about 20,000 years ago; a date of less then 10,000 BP on a lava flow is uncertain.

The second eruptive period from about 102 to 53 ka included the formation of the Monte San Angelo and Costa d'Agosto stratovolcanoes in the center of the island. The third eruptive cycle (40 ka to the present) included the Monte Guardia sequence, erupted at the southern tip of the island between about 22,600 and 16,800 years ago, and Holocene rhyolitic pyroclastic deposits and obsidian lava flows at the NE end of the island. The latest eruption, at Monte Pilato on the NE tip of the island, formed the Rocche Rosse and Forgia Vecchia obsidian lava flows, which have been dated variously from about 500 to 1230 CE.

La Fossa cone, active throughout the Holocene and the location of most historical eruptions, occupies the 3-km-wide Caldera della Fossa at the NW end of the elongated 3 x 7 km island. The Vulcanello lava platform is a low, roughly circular peninsula on the northern tip of Vulcano that was formed as an island beginning more than 2,000 years ago and was connected to the main island in about 1550 CE. Vulcanello is capped by three pyroclastic cones and was active intermittently until the 16th century.

Historical lava flows of basaltic composition cover much of the surface of this massive volcano, whose edifice is the highest and most voluminous in Italy. The Mongibello stratovolcano, truncated by several small calderas, was constructed during the late Pleistocene and Holocene over an older shield volcano. The most prominent morphological feature of Etna is the Valle del Bove, a 5 x 10 km caldera open to the east. Two styles of eruptive activity typically occur, sometimes simultaneously. Persistent explosive eruptions, sometimes with minor lava emissions, take place from one or more summit craters. Flank vents, typically with higher effusion rates, are less frequently active and originate from fissures that open progressively downward from near the summit (usually accompanied by Strombolian eruptions at the upper end). Cinder cones are commonly constructed over the vents of lower-flank lava flows. Lava flows extend to the foot of the volcano on all sides and have reached the sea over a broad area on the SE flank.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Mount Etna, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Submarine eruptions were reported at the Giulia-Ferdinandeo and Pinne banks during the first Punic war (264-241 BCE), and from the 17th to 20th centuries, sometimes producing ephemeral islands. The 1831 eruption at Ferdinandea (also known as Graham in English or Giulia/Julia in French) produced an ephemeral island that was promptly claimed by the navies of France, Britain, Spain, and Italy.",

The 15-km-long island is the emergent summit of a largely submarine edifice. The 6-km-wide Cinque Denti caldera, the youngest of the two calderas, formed about 45,000 years ago and contains the two post-caldera shield volcanoes of Monte Grande and Monte Gibele. Holocene eruptions have constructed pumice cones, lava domes, and short, blocky lava flows. Many Holocene vents are located on three sides of the uplifted Montagna Grande block on the SE side of the island. A submarine eruption in 1891 from a vent ~4 km off the NW coast is the only confirmed historical activity.",

The latest activity during the late Pleistocene was concentrated in the eastern half of the low, U-shaped Mílos Island, forming lava domes and phreatic explosion craters, and on Antimílos Island to the NW, where a composite volcano was constructed. The youngest magmatic eruptions took place about 90,000 years ago, but phreatic explosions, commonly producing overlapping craters rarely more than 1 km in diameter, continued from late-Pleistocene to Recent times. A lahar deposit in SE Mílos, east of Fyriplaka tuff ring, buried walls of a Roman harbor town and overlies a coarse ash layer, and was considered to originate from a small phreatic explosion through basement rocks.",

The age of the caldera is variously considered to be less than 24,000 years before present (BP) (Keller et al., 1990) and older than 44,000 years BP (Limburg and Varekamp, 1991). Five large post-caldera lava domes completely fill the western part of the caldera. The NE-most (Boriatiko) and SW-most (Karaviotis) lava domes and flows are significantly younger than the other domes. A sixth post-caldera dome, outside the SW caldera rim, produced lava flows that reached the coast. Historical phreatic eruptions occurred from craters within the caldera between 1422 and 1888. Intense hydrothermal activity continues in the form of many fumaroles on the caldera floor and hot springs along the coast.",

The modern edifice within the latest caldera is the youngest of four major basaltic-to-rhyolitic volcanic complexes dating back to the mid-Miocene. Andesitic-to-dacitic lava domes form the two principal summits, of which the westernmost is the highest and is capped by two nested craters. Lava domes and associated pyroclastic-flow deposits cover more than half the flanks. As defined by Uslular et al. (2021), this volcanic field also includes the Pliocene-Quaternary Keçiboyduran stratovolcano, along with numerous monogenetic features: 11 lava domes (andesitic to rhyolitic), 33 scoria cones (basaltic), one maar (basaltic), and 34 undifferentiated features. Interpretations of Neolithic paintings representing eruptions are controversial, but geologic evidence supports eruptive activity continuing into the Holocene. Uslular et al. (2021) reported a lava dome possibly as young as 9,000 years BP (U-Th/He, citing Friedrichs et al., 2020, and Schmitt et al., 2014).",

(2021) identified 100 lava domes (dacitic to rhyolitic), 40 scoria cones (basaltic to andesitic), four maars (basaltic andesitic), and 44 undifferentiated features as part of this complex. Growth of the modern edifice began about 900,000 years ago, following Pliocene caldera collapse of the Kocdag complex. The youngest dated rock was from an 83,000-year-old dacitic lava flow, but rhyodacitic eruptions and lava dome growth occurred later at the Perikartin dome. One of the latest documented events was an edifice collapse that produced a large debris avalanche that extended to the east. An early Holocene distal tephra layer in Lebanon was attributed to Erciyes Dagi. Uncertainty remains regarding reported eruptions and their possible depiction on Roman Cappadocian coins. Accounts possibly referring to eruptions could also be attributed to methane releases from a swamp in the Sultansazligi Basin.",

It contains a 9 x 5 km caldera partially filled on its western side by a caldera lake. Post-caldera volcanism, of basaltic to rhyolitic composition, initially occurred along the caldera rim and floor. Pyroclastic flows and the emission of glassy obsidian lava flows accompanied construction of lava domes within the caldera; later activity formed a series of cinder cones and lava domes erupted along N-S-trending fissures on the northern flank. The most recent activity has been concentrated along a NNW-trending fissure cutting the eastern caldera floor and extending beyond the north caldera rim; nearly two dozen cinder cones and lava domes were constructed on the caldera floor. Ash layers in Lake Van document numerous Holocene eruptions, and an historical eruption in 1441 CE from a N-flank fissure involved compositionally bimodal lava flows.",

An E-W summit ridge, developed north of an arcuate caldera structure exposed only on the southern side, contains two well-developed cones. The higher western cone is capped by a steep-walled crater with a trachytic spine at its eastern edge. The flatter eastern crater contains a warm lake. The shield volcano developed during a period when highly mobile lava flows from the western crater covered an area of 500 km2. Following summit caldera formation, numerous flank eruptions took place from N-S-trending fissures, producing viscous trachytic lava domes and flows as well as fluid basaltic pahoehoe flows that extend 10-20 km N and S. The latest activity formed two major basaltic lava flows from large cones on the NE and SE flanks. An eruption took place from a vent on the SE flank about 2500 years ago, and a gas-and-ash eruption took place in 1855.",

Construction of the Greater and Lesser Ararat volcanoes was followed by a period of extensive flank eruptions, many erupted along N-S fissures. The initial stage of flank eruptions produced a cluster of cinder cones and dacitic-rhyolitic lava domes surrounding Greater Ararat and a series of pyroclastic cones and domes on the W flank of Lesser Ararat. Late-stage activity formed large pyroclastic cones lower on the flanks of the two volcanoes. Ararat appears to have been active during the 3rd millennium BCE; pyroclastic-flow deposits overlie early Bronze Age artifacts and human remains. Karakhanian et al. (2002) reported historical evidence for a phreatic eruption and pyroclastic flow at the time of a July 1840 earthquake and landslide.",

Oswald (1906) noted that steep escarpments of Nummulitic limestones faced the “Dalykh-tapa” volcano, about 6 km NE across an extensive lava-flow field. Near the north end of the approximately 5 x 8 km flow field the 1.5-km-diameter cone rises about 300 m above the surrounding lavas, identified by Sviatlovsky (1959) as post-glacial. At the southern end of the flow field a fissure-fed lava flow several thousand years ago dammed the Arpah River near the town of Vyke and then flowed NW for 6 km; the flows overlie a late Pleistocene terrace and have little soil development (Karakhanian et al., 2002). The youthful-looking Smbatassar cinder cone, 17 km NW of Vaiyots-Sar, appears to be the source vent for Holocene lava flows that traveled 11 km N and 17 km S down two valleys (Karakhanian et al., 2002).",

Two large lava flows traveled up to 21 km north and NW, and fresh-looking lava flows form peninsulas extending into Lake Alagyol. Fifth century BCE petroglyphs were interpreted to depict volcanic eruptions (Karakhanian et al., 2002).

The platform and eruptive vents forming the islands and shoals are oriented NNW-SSE, parallel to the rift. An early explosive phase was followed by a brief period of marine erosion, then by renewed explosive activity accompanied by the extrusion of basaltic pahoehoe lava flows. This latest phase of activity occurred on the morphologically youngest islands of Zubair, Centre Peak, Saba, and Haycock. Historical explosive activity was reported from Saddle Island in the 19th century. Spatter cones and pyroclastic cones were erupted along fissures that form the low spine of Zubair Island. Eruptions that began in late 2011 built two new islands, increasing the total number in the group to 12.",

The second created 19 small craters at the summit in 1861. Ash fell more than 300 km from the volcano. Two villages were destroyed and more than 100 people were killed during Africa's largest eruption in historical time.

A small basaltic shield volcano is located at the N end of the complex, S of which is an area of abundant fissure-fed lava flows. Two basaltic shield volcanoes, the larger of which is Unda Hararo, occupy the center of the complex. The dominant Gumatmali-Gablaytu fissure system lies to the S. Voluminous fluid lava flows issued from these NNW-trending fissures, and solidified lava lakes occupy two large craters. The small Gablaytu shield volcano forms the SE-most end of the complex. Lava flows from Gablaytu and from Manda overlie 8,000-year-old sediments. Hot springs and fumaroles occur around Daorre lake. The first historical eruptions produced fissure-fed lava flows in 2007 and 2009.",

These lavas were thought to have been erupted during the past 3,000 years (Delibrias et al., 1975).

Nested circular craters are located at the summit of the dominantly basaltic volcano, which also displays an older caldera rim. An arcuate chain of rhyolitic lava domes occupies the northern, western, and southern flanks. Youthful basaltic lava flows surround these domes and cover the flanks, and recent flows also cover the young sediments of the Kalo and Abhe basins. The Asmara basaltic pyroclastic cone located in the southern Kalo basin SW of the base of the volcano was considered to have had activity during the last 2,000 years (IAVCEI, 1973). It is considered the most likely source of an eruption reported to have occurred in 1631 (Gouin, 1979). Major fumarolic activity occurs in the summit crater, and abundant hot springs are found on the volcano.",

Welded pantelleritic ash flows accompanied formation of a 2.5 x 4.5 km summit caldera, with steep-sided walls. Elliptically shaped, it trends WNW-ESE, perpendicular to the Ethiopian Rift. Post-caldera vents lie along the same orientation. Trachytic and obsidian lava flows occur on the caldera floor, and fresh-looking lava flows descend the flanks. An eruption during the 13th century destroyed an Abyssinian town and church to the south. In 1820 CE basaltic lava flows effused from a 4-km-long fissure on the S flank; lava also flowed onto the caldera floor.",

Subsequent volcanism focused around three post-caldera edifices (Artu, Urji, and Chabbi) and a rhyolitic cone (Biftu Tuff Cone), situated outside the south-eastern caldera wall.... The eroded remains of Artu cone partly cover the northeastern section of the caldera, and younger products from Chabbi shield entirely cover the eastern portion of the caldera wall.\" The Wendo Koshe Younger Pumice (WKYP) has been 14C dated by Rapprich et al. (2016) to around 396 BCE; stratigraphic correlations indicate more recent eruptions, including four obsidian lava flows (Rapprich et al., 2016) and possibly two smaller explosive eruptions (Colby et al., 2022). Additional undated deposits are present between the WKYP event and the formation of the Biftu Tuff Cone after 5425 BCE (Colby et al., 2022).",

(2020) provides an excellent review of this field, from which most of this summary is taken. The field includes 114 monogenetic centers, primarily cinder cones and some maars; the largest maar is the 2.3-km-diameter El Sod. Uneroded lava flows often partially overly deeply eroded lava flows. Large lava flows are usually associated with cinder cones, but fissure-fed flows in the Megado area exhibit oriented spatter ramparts. One of the largest lava flows extends more than 10 km SW from the Mega escarpment and covers about 25 km2; it has a very fresh, black, glassy appearance of the surface, and minimal vegetation. Two samples analyzed by Franceschini et al. (2020) yielded 40Ar/39Ar ages of 0.116 ± 0.005 and 0.044 ± 0.008 Ma; two other samples indicated very recent Holocene ages. These are the first age dates available for this field, and are in agreement with the morphological interpretation of some young cinder cones and lava flows.",

The two blocky lava flows are younger than a terrace that formed less than 10,000 years ago during the last major high-water level (Key and Watkins, 1988).

Several small islands to the SE represent partially submerged crater rims, and other cones and lava plugs lie beneath the lake surface near the island. The youngest tuffs and lavas may be as young as Holocene (Karson and Curtis, 1992). Fumarolic activity is concentrated along the NE-to-SE rim of the central crater, and sprays of sulfur from the fumaroles were observed by visitors in the 1930s.

The main phase of shield construction occurred during the Pliocene. Quaternary activity shifted to explosive activity that formed maars accompanied by further extensive effusion of lava flows. The youngest dated lava flow has a Potassium-Argon age of 0.68 ± 0.16 million years, but more recent activity has also occurred. The youngest lava flows are unvegetated, and Key (1987) mapped the post-shield cinder cones as Pleistocene-to-Recent in age.",

Fluid olivine basalts were also erupted from a breached scoria cone, forming the summit. The youngest eruptions postdated the drying out of Lake Sugata about 3000 years ago. Some could be as recent as the historical eruptions at The Barrier volcano to the north (Dunkley et al., 1993).

A 5 x 3.5 km summit caldera formed about 38,000 years ago. Since then trachytic and basaltic lava flows were erupted on the northern and southern flanks and within the caldera. A NNE-SSW-trending chain of lake-filled basaltic maars extends along the floor of the rift from the lower flanks of the volcano. Young lava flows were also erupted from vents along rift valley faults. Well-preserved parasitic cones erupted along rift-parallel faults cutting the volcano abound; the latest eruption produced a trachytic lava flow dated from secular magnetic variation measurements at about the beginning of the 20th century. Fumarolic activity and hot steaming ground occurs along NNE-trending fissures within the caldera and along the lower NW flanks.",

An impressive 5 x 8 km summit caldera with 300 m deep walls is thought to have formed about 63,000 years ago. Caldera formation is thought to have been incremental, related to eruption of the Kantenmening basaltic and trachytic lava flows. A series of summit-area lava benches formed by eruptions from circumferential fissures has produced a volcano morphologically similar to Galapagos Islands volcanoes. The N, E, and S flanks are cut by a prominent broad rift zone 10 km wide and 30 km long, dotted with numerous pyroclastic cones. Lava domes on the upper E flank formed during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, until about 7 ka. Youthful parasitic cones abound on the caldera floor and on the N and NE flanks; the youngest lava flows may be little more than a few hundred years old (Williams et al. 1984). Geothermal activity occurs within the caldera and on the upper E flanks.",

A second large crater SE of the caldera is 0.5 x 1 km wide and contains a pumice cone. The summit caldera is narrowly breached on the N side, which has funneled post-caldera lava flows in this direction. The three youngest post-caldera pyroclastic cones on the NE flank may be only a few hundred years old. A series of viscous trachytic lava flows were erupted from vents on the lower flanks. Young fissure-fed basalts were also erupted to the S, between Paka and Korosi volcanoes. Surficial geothermal activity is widespread at Paka, both within the summit caldera and on extensive portions of the N flank.",

This was followed by the eruption of trachytic lava domes and pumice/scoria cones. The youngest activity, consisting of fissure-fed basaltic lava flows on the lower N flanks between Korosi and Paka, was probably coeval with the latest eruptions on Ol Kokwe to the S, which are only a few hundred to a few thousand years old (Dunkley et al. 1993).

Its large elongated summit crater is truncated on the north by a ring graben. This unusual 5-km-wide circular graben at the center of the older caldera isolates a tilted island block of caldera-floor lava flows. The latest eruptions have originated from satellitic vents that issued lava flows which remain unvegetated and may be only a century or so old.",

The cone-building stage ended about 15,000 years ago and was followed by periodic ejection of natrocarbonatitic and nephelinite tephra during the Holocene. Historical eruptions have consisted of smaller tephra ejections and emission of numerous natrocarbonatitic lava flows on the floor of the summit crater and occasionally down the upper flanks. The depth and morphology of the northern crater have changed dramatically during the course of historical eruptions, ranging from steep crater walls about 200 m deep in the mid-20th century to shallow platforms mostly filling the crater. Long-term lava effusion in the summit crater beginning in 1983 had by the turn of the century mostly filled the northern crater; by late 1998 lava had begun overflowing the crater rim.",

Two pyroclastic cones with well-preserved craters are present, with a central cone and crater adjacent to the NE crater that contains a solidified lava lake. The NE crater is the largest feature, at 370 m in diameter, and has been breached on the ENE side; this was the source of a lava flow about 1 km long and wide. The SW crater is also breached on the ENE side, with a smaller lava flow on the E flank. Cosmogenic Helium ages for the Igwisi Hills eruption with wide uncertainties range from late Pleistocene to mid-Holocene (Brown et al., 2012).",

Numerous pyroclastic cones are situated along the ridge. Eruption of the Kitulo Pumice, radiocarbon dated at about 10,200 cal. years before present, is though to be related to formation of the caldera. The youngest activity appears to have originated from the caldera and from youthful-looking pyroclastic cones to the north; the youngest known eruption produced a pyroclastic flow that swept at least 10 km S about 500 years ago.",

Its rim and flanks are blanketed with ejected schists, and it contains a freshwater lake in its summit crater. Two lava flows traveled to the NE from vents on the N and NE flanks. The age of the cone is uncertain, but it is contemporaneous with late Pleistocene to Holocene tuff cones in the Bunyaruguru area; the undissected condition of the cone and associated lava flows implies a young age.",

The steep slopes of a stratovolcano contrast to the low profile of its neighboring shield volcano, Nyamuragira. Benches in the steep-walled, 1.2-km-wide summit crater mark levels of former lava lakes, which have been observed since the late-19th century. Two older stratovolcanoes, Baruta and Shaheru, are partially overlapped by Nyiragongo on the north and south. About 100 parasitic cones are located primarily along radial fissures south of Shaheru, east of the summit, and along a NE-SW zone extending as far as Lake Kivu. Many cones are buried by voluminous lava flows that extend long distances down the flanks, which is characterized by the eruption of foiditic rocks. The extremely fluid 1977 lava flows caused many fatalities, as did lava flows that inundated portions of the major city of Goma in January 2002.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Virunga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

More than 100 parasitic cones erupted along a NNE-SSW zone that extends to the shores of Lake Kivu. The youngest Potassium-Argon date obtained is about 10,000 years before present (de Mulder, 1985). The youngest eruptions produced a group of dome-shaped parasitic vents east of the caldera, which fed viscous lava flows that traveled as far as 12 km E, and lava flows from the SW-flank satellitic lava vents.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Volcans Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The massive steep-sided volcano of dominantly basaltic-to-trachybasaltic composition forms a volcanic horst constructed above a basement of Precambrian metamorphic rocks covered with Cretaceous to Quaternary sediments. More than 100 small cinder cones, often fissure-controlled parallel to the long axis of the 1400 km3 edifice, occur on the flanks and surrounding lowlands. A large satellitic peak, Etinde (also known as Little Cameroon), is located on the S flank near the coast. Historical activity was first observed in the 5th century BCE by the Carthaginian navigator Hannon. During historical time, moderate explosive and effusive eruptions have occurred from both summit and flank vents. A 1922 SW-flank eruption produced a lava flow that reached the Atlantic coast, and a lava flow from a 1999 south-flank eruption stopped only 200 m from the sea. Explosive activity from two vents on the upper SE flank was reported in May 2000.",

Legends record an eruption of Le Djungo (also known as Mont Pelé) that destroyed a village; though a small craterless cone is marked along a fault line on a map in Nkono (2009, after Nkouathio et al., 2002) it's unclear what cone is being described by the story, because no noticeably younger or unvegetated cones are apparent in satellite imagery.

The Lake Nyos event on 21 August 1986 caused at least 1,700 fatalities. The emission of ~1 km3 of magmatic carbon dioxide has been attributed either to overturn of stratified lake waters as a result of a non-volcanic process, or to phreatic explosions or injection of hot gas into the lake.",

Most vents are cinder cones that produced lava flows which breached the cones. About 10% of vents in the field are explosion craters, the largest of which, named Hosh ed Dalam, is 1.3 km wide and up to 500 m deep. The youngest basalts appear to post-date the last period of moist climate in Sudan, which ended as recently as about 5,000 years ago.

Al Harrah, a large basaltic volcanic field in northwestern Saudi Arabia, covers an area of 15,200 km2 and forms the southern third of the harrat across a 210-km-long, roughly 75-km-wide area. Other fields include the Jabal ad Druze, Es Safa, Golan Heights, and the Kra Lava Field where radiocarbon dating indicated an eruption at 2670 BCE ± 200 years. Although a \"boiling lava lake\" eruption has been in the volcanological literature since 1925, a translation of the original source of that report by Wetzstein (1860) clearly shows that he was describing solidified crater floor surface features and lava flows.",

Harrat Lunayyir is one of the smallest of the Holocene lava fields of Saudi Arabia, but individual flow lobes radiate long distances from the center of the Harrat, and flows reached the Red Sea in two places. Lava flows are basaltic to basanitic in composition, and the Holocene flows are alkali olivine basalts. One of the cones may have erupted around the 10th century CE or earlier.

Volcanic activity dates back to the Miocene and concluded with the formation of Holocene cinder cones (Brown et al., 1984). The Quaternary lava flows are of basaltic to trachybasaltic composition and contain ultramafic inclusions. Cinder cones are scattered throughout the volcanic field, with a few late-stage cones (Ba'a and Qishr) NE of the main lava field. Isolated patches of freshly eroded ash surround a vent at Jabal Ba'a, east of the main field, suggesting an eruption during the last century.",

Baker et al. (1997) include outcrops of Quaternary volcanism south of the main area of lava flows, such as Jabal al Marha, as part of this system, but note that they can be difficult to distinguish from Oligocene flood basalts.

Volcanism began roughly 15-10 million years ago (Pelleter et al., 2014; Nougier et al., 1986), and has included basaltic lava flows, nephelinite, tephrite, phonolitic domes, and pyroclastic deposits (Nehlig et al., 2013). Lavas on the NE were active from about 4.7 to 1.4 million years and on the south from about 7.7 to 2.7 million years. Mafic activity resumed on the north from about 2.9 to 1.2 million years and on the south from about 2 to 1.5 million years. Several pumice layers found in cores on the barrier reef-lagoon complex indicate that volcanism likely occurred less than 7,000 years ago (Zinke et al., 2003). More recent activity that began in May 2018 consisted of seismicity and ground deformation occurring offshore E of Mayotte Island (Lemoine et al., 2019). One year later, in May 2019, a new subaqueous edifice and associated lava flows were observed 50 km E of Petite Terre during an oceanographic campaign.",

More than twenty eruptions have been recorded since the 19th century from the summit caldera and vents on the N and S flanks. Many lava flows have reached the sea on both sides of the island.

        "geologicalSummary": "Piton de la Fournaise is a massive basaltic shield volcano on the French island of Réunion in the western Indian Ocean. Much of its more than 530,000-year history overlapped with eruptions of the deeply dissected Piton des Neiges shield volcano to the NW. Three scarps formed at about 250,000, 65,000, and less than 5,000 years ago by progressive eastward slumping, leaving caldera-sized embayments open to the E and SE. Numerous pyroclastic cones are present on the floor of the scarps and their outer flanks. Most recorded eruptions have originated from the summit and flanks of Dolomieu, a 400-m-high lava shield that has grown within the youngest scarp, which is about 9 km wide and about 13 km from the western wall to the ocean on the E side. More than 150 eruptions, most of which have produced fluid basaltic lava flows, have occurred since the 17th century. Only six eruptions, in 1708, 1774, 1776, 1800, 1977, and 1986, have originated from fissures outside the scarps.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Pitons, Cirques et Remparts de I'ile de la Reunion, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

It rises to within 650 m of the ocean surface and has a 2-km-wide summit caldera that is 200 m deep. Rift zones that extend to the SE and N give it an arcuate shape. A basaltic volcano, it lies along the axis of the Southeast Indian Ridge and marks the site of the Amsterdam-St. Paul hotspot. This hotspot may have been the source of the Ninetyeast Ridge submarine volcanoes on the Australian Plate prior to its \"capture\" by the Southeast Indian Ridge, after which volcanism was restricted to the Antarctic Plate. Very short half-life radionuclide dating of fresh volcanic glass samples recovered during the 1996 expedition indicated that it had erupted only about 5 months earlier (Johnson et al., 2000). Water column temperature anomalies above the seamount suggest the presence of hydrothermal activity within the caldera.",

The caldera of the youngest eruptive center, 2 km ENE of the earlier one, contained a lava lake that fed several stages of lava outflows. Minor late-stage eruptions formed more than two dozen scoria cones and many small lava flows. No observed eruptions are known, although the fresh morphology at Dumas Crater on the NE flank suggests it may have occurred as recently as a century ago (Nougier, 1982).",

Volcanic plumes were observed in December 1996 and January 1997 from McDonald Island. During March 1997 the crew of a vessel that sailed near the island noted vigorous steaming from a vent on the N side of the island along with possible pyroclastic deposits and lava flows. A satellite image taken in November 2001 showed the island to have more than doubled in area since previous reported observations in November 2000.

The structural center of the volcano is located on the W side of the 14 x 19 km island, which has an irregular shoreline. The stratovolcano was formed during at least five stages dating back to the Miocene. The eruption of plateau basalts from a rift system during stage IV was followed by a glacial period and then by the eruption of scoria cones and lava flows. The young scoria cones are of probable Holocene age and are distributed over much of the island, concentrated at the structural center on the W side and along a series of N-S and NE-trending fractures. The Mont Branca cone on the W flank has been estimated by Bellair (1964) to be not more than a few centuries old.",

The earliest dated eruptions took place about 450,000 years ago, but much of the island is covered by Holocene aa and pahoehoe lava flows, and more than 130 scoria cones formed during the Holocene. Many of these appear younger than the 4,020 BP peat layer overlying one of the flows (Verwoerd, 1981). Unvegetated lava flows appear to be only a few hundred years old (Verwoerd, 1967). An eruption in 1980 produced explosive activity and lava flows from a 5-km-long fissure that extended from the summit to the west coast.",

A 3-km-wide composite caldera was formed in two or three collapse events, the last of which took place about 6300 years ago, and was accompanied by a Plinian eruption that produced tephra deposits up to 70 cm thick on mainland North Island.

        "geologicalSummary": "The uninhabited Whakaari/White Island is the 2 x 2.4 km emergent summit of a 16 x 18 km submarine volcano in the Bay of Plenty about 50 km offshore of North Island. The island consists of two overlapping andesitic-to-dacitic stratovolcanoes. The SE side of the crater is open at sea level, with the recent activity centered about 1 km from the shore close to the rear crater wall. Volckner Rocks, sea stacks that are remnants of a lava dome, lie 5 km NW. Descriptions of volcanism since 1826 have included intermittent moderate phreatic, phreatomagmatic, and Strombolian eruptions; activity there also forms a prominent part of Maori legends. The formation of many new vents during the 19th and 20th centuries caused rapid changes in crater floor topography. Collapse of the crater wall in 1914 produced a debris avalanche that buried buildings and workers at a sulfur-mining project. Explosive activity in December 2019 took place while tourists were present, resulting in many fatalities. The official government name Whakaari/White Island is a combination of the full Maori name of Te Puia o Whakaari (\"The Dramatic Volcano\") and White Island (referencing the constant steam plume) given by Captain James Cook in 1769.",

Lava domes of the Haroharo complex, at the northern end of the Okataina Volcanic Centre, occupy part of the 16 x 26 km Pleistocene Haroharo caldera, which formed incrementally between 300,000 and 50,000 years before present (BP). The oldest exposed rocks on the caldera floor are about 22,000 years old. The Tarawera complex at the southern end of Okataina consists of 11 rhyolitic lava domes and associated lava flows. The oldest domes were formed as late as about 15,000 years BP, and the youngest were formed in the Kaharoa eruption about 800 years BP. The NE-SW Tarawera vent lineation extends from the two dacitic cones of Maungaongaonga and Mangakakaramea on the SW to Mount Edgecumbe on the NE. Construction of the Haroharo and Tarawera complexes impounded lakes Rotoiti, Totoehu, Okataina, and Tarawera against the outer margins of the Okataina ring structure. A major hydrothermal area is located at Waimangu; the world-renowned Pink and White Terrace siliceous sinter deposits were destroyed during the major basaltic explosive eruption of 1886.",

It is a type example of an \"inverse volcano\" that slopes inward towards the most recent vent location. The caldera, now filled by Lake Taupo, largely formed as a result of the voluminous eruption of the Oruanui Tephra about 22,600 years before present (BP). This was the largest known eruption at Taupo, producing about 1,170 km3 of tephra. This eruption was preceded during the late Pleistocene by the eruption of a large number of rhyolitic lava domes north of Lake Taupo. Large explosive eruptions have occurred frequently during the Holocene from many vents within Lake Taupo and near its margins. The most recent major eruption took place about 1,800 years BP from at least three vents along a NE-SW-trending fissure centered on the Horomotangi Reefs. This extremely violent eruption was New Zealand's largest during the Holocene and produced the thin but widespread phreatoplinian Taupo Ignimbrite, which covered 20,000 km2 of North Island.",

A series of subplinian eruptions took place between about 22,600 and 10,000 years ago, but pyroclastic flows have been infrequent. The broad summait area and flank contain at least six vents active during the Holocene. Frequent mild-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded from the Te Wai ā-Moe (Crater Lake) vent, and tephra characteristics suggest that the crater lake may have formed as recently as 3,000 years ago.

The pre-caldera edifice consisted of two generations of shield volcanoes separated by a period of pyroclastic cone growth. Eruption of the voluminous Sandy Bay Tuff about 6,300 years ago truncated the NW side of the Annexation shield volcano and formed a 12-km-wide, 1.1-km deep caldera. Following formation of the caldera and substantial marine erosion, a partly submarine and partly subaerial eruption centered about 2 km N of present-day Macauley Island produced basaltic scoriae and lava flows. A reported possible eruption in 1825 from \"Brimstone Island,\" 45 km W of Macauley at a location with a depth of about 2,000 m and SW of Giggenbach submarine volcano, is likely a location error and could refer to an eruption from the submarine flank of Macauley caldera (Lloyd et al., 1996).",

Denham caldera, formed during a major dacitic explosive eruption about 2200 years ago, truncated the W side of the island and is 6.5 x 4 km wide. Its long axis is parallel to the tectonic fabric of the Havre Trough that lies W of the volcanic arc. Historical eruptions during the 19th and 20th centuries have sometimes occurred simultaneously from both calderas, and have consisted of small-to-moderate phreatic eruptions, some of which formed ephemeral islands in Denham caldera. An unnamed submarine cone, one of several located along a fissure on the lower NNE flank, has also erupted during historical time, and satellitic vents are concentrated along two parallel NNE-trending lineaments.",

Numerous eruptions have been identified using submarine acoustic signals since it was first recognized as a volcano in 1977. A shoal that had been reported in 1944 may have been a pumice raft or water disturbance due to degassing. Surface observations have included water discoloration, vigorous gas bubbling, and areas of upwelling water, sometimes accompanied by rumbling noises.

The topmost sequence of welded and unwelded ignimbrite units from a caldera-forming eruption was 14C dated to 1040-1180 CE (Cronin et al., 2017; Brenna et al. 2022). At least two additional welded pumice-rich ignimbrite units and nonwelded pyroclastic flow deposits, below paleosols and other volcaniclastic deposits, indicated more very large previous eruptions (Cronin et al., 2017; Brenna et al. 2022). Several submarine eruptions have occurred at this caldera system since the first recorded eruption in 1912, including 1937 and S of the islands in 1988. A short eruption in 2009 added land to to Hunga Ha'apai. At that time the two islands were each about 2 km long, displaying inward-facing sea cliffs with lava and tephra layers dipping gently away from the caldera. An eruption during December 2014-January 2015 was centered between the islands, and combined them into one larger structure. Major explosive eruptions in late 2021 initially reshaped the central part of the combined island before stronger activity in mid-January 2022 removed most of the 2014-15 material; an even larger eruption the next day sent an eruption plume high into the stratosphere, triggered shock waves through the atmosphere and tsunami across the Pacific Ocean, and left only small remnants of the islands above the ocean surface.",

Three post-caldera cones were constructed at the northern end of a cold fresh-water caldera lake, whose surface lies only 30 m above sea level.

The largest and northernmost of the cones, Lofia, has a steep-sided crater that is 70 m wide and 120 m deep and has been the source of historical eruptions, first reported in the 18th century.

The volcano is in the rear arc of the Tonga-Kermadec Arc System, ~40 km W of the chain of edifices that define the volcanic front, and 25 km E of the central ridge of the Northeast Lau Spreading Center. The composition of the cone and surrounding floor is predominantly dacite. Towing with sea floor cameras over the cone and various parts of the caldera in 2012 resulted in the discovery of at least three sources of hydrothermal particle venting on the cone's summit and adjacent to the inner caldera walls. The Tonga Ministry of Lands, Environment, Climate Change and Natural Resources named the volcano Niuatahi, which means 'sea' in Tongan, with the small cone of Motutahi meaning 'island in the sea.'",

The summit contains an oval-shaped crater that is 2 km wide and 400 m deep. Two principal rift zones extend E and W from the summit, parallel to the trend of the hotspot; a third rift extends SE. The rift zones and escarpments produced by mass wasting phenomena give the seamount a star-shaped pattern. On 10 July 1973 explosions were recorded by SOFAR (hydrophone records of underwater acoustic signals). An earthquake swarm in 1995 may have been related to an eruption. Eruptive activity between April 2001 and April 2005 formed a cone almost 300 m high, named Nafanua. Repeated bathymetric mapping surveys showed depth changes, including height and width increases of Nafanua after 2005, that suggest at least intermittent activity during 1999-2017; a 2019 survey showed no further changes since 2017.",

The islands are formed by two eroded, coalescing basaltic shield volcanoes whose slopes dip to the east and west. Steep cliffs up to 600-m high truncate the northern and southern sides of the islands. The narrow, steep-sided ridge forming the eastern tip of Ofu Island consists of a dike complex. The shield volcano on Ofu is cut on the north by the A'ofa caldera; bathymetry suggests that a caldera may also exist on the Sili shield volcano of Olosega. The Nu'utele tuff cone, forming a small crescent-shaped island immediately off the west end of Ofu Island, is Holocene in age. A submarine eruption took place in 1866 at the opposite end of the two islands, 3 km SE of Olosega, along the ridge connecting Olosega with Ta'u Island.",

The caldera is now partially filled by cinder cones and trachytic lava domes. ENE-trending dike complexes are prominently exposed on Pago volcano. Following a lengthy period of erosion, submergence, and the construction of a barrier reef, the Leone Volcanics were erupted during the Holocene along a 5-km-long N-S-trending fissure over a broad area at the southernmost part of the island (Stearns, 1944), forming a group of initially submarine tuff cones and subsequent subaerial cinder cones that produced fresh-looking pahoehoe lava flows. An ash layer overlying a cultural deposit in the SW part of the island was radiocarbon dated at about 440 ± 200 CE (Addison et al., 2006).",

The most extensive activity during the Pleistocene took place along a 20-km segment along the central axis of the island. Following a lengthy period of erosion, the latest lava flows, at least three of which were estimated to be as young as a few hundred to a few thousand years old, were erupted from vents near the crest of the island at its center and western side (Stearns, 1944). One of the youngest flows reached the north-central coast along a roughly 1.5-km-wide front east of Vailele Bay, and another traveled down the Lefaga River channel and reached the SW coast at Lefaga Bay. Apolima Island off the western tip of Upolu is a Holocene tuff cone too young to be fringed by a coral reef, and other reef-free areas along the coastline may be formed by Holocene lava flows.",

Late-stage Pleistocene and Holocene eruptions produced voluminous lava flows that partially buried fringing reefs. Numerous cinder cones and lava cones dot the broad crest of Savai'i, which has a low-angle, dome-like profile and reaches an elevation of 1858 m. Additional cones occur on the north-central flank, and a large number are found in the south-central part of the island. Three eruptions, including two in the 20th century, occurred in historical time, and produced voluminous lava flows that reached the northern coast along broad fronts up to about 15 km wide, destroying several villages and overtopping fringing reefs.",

Two summit craters are present; both are active, although most observed eruptions have originated from the southern crater, concentrating eruptive products during much of the past century into the SE valley. Frequent eruptions, typically of mild-to-moderate scale, have been recorded since 1616.

The latter was one of the largest historical eruptions in Papua New Guinea and deposited andesitic tephra across the New Guinea highlands, prompting legends of a \"Time of Darkness.\" Post-caldera eruptions have constructed a small cone, Motmot Island, in the south-central part of Lake Wisdom.

Two vertical fault-bounded blocks form topographic highs at the western and eastern sides of the caldera. A N-S line of post-caldera cones, explosion craters, and part of an arcuate inner caldera rim form a large peninsula that nearly bisects the arcuate caldera lake. The peninsula includes the 350-m-high andesitic Mount Makalia stratovolcano, the largest of the post-caldera cones, which last erupted during the late-19th century. A major submarine debris avalanche deposit NE of the volcano may represent edifice collapse prior to caldera formation. Thermal areas occur at several locations along the central peninsula.",

A steep-walled valley cuts the NW side, and a flank lava-flow complex lies to the south of this valley. Historical eruptions date back to the beginning of the 18th century.

The 8 x 14 km caldera is widely breached on the east, where its floor is flooded by Blanche Bay and was formed about 1,400 years ago. An earlier caldera-forming eruption about 7,100 years ago is thought to have originated from Tavui caldera, offshore to the north. Three small stratovolcanoes lie outside the N and NE caldera rims. Post-caldera eruptions built basaltic-to-dacitic pyroclastic cones on the caldera floor near the NE and W caldera walls. Several of these, including Vulcan cone, which was formed during a large eruption in 1878, have produced major explosive activity during historical time. A powerful explosive eruption in 1994 occurred simultaneously from Vulcan and Tavurvur volcanoes and forced the temporary abandonment of Rabaul city.",

The caldera was first discovered during a bathymetric cruise in 1985. The SW wall of the roughly 10 x 12 km caldera cuts the NE end of the peninsula and extends from Tavui Point at the northern tip of the peninsula SE to Laweo Point. The 7,100-year-old Raluan Ignimbrite, initially thought to have originated from Rabaul, is now thought to have been produced by an eruption of Tavui. A basaltic scoria layer immediately underlies the rhyolitic ignimbrite, and the introduction of basaltic magma was considered to have triggered the rhyolitic eruption. The lack of a major low-velocity region detectable beneath the caldera during a seismic tomography survey suggests that it is not currently active.",

The summit crater is breached to the SE and is of possible landslide origin. Several near-summit lava domes are present, the SE-most of which marks the summit. Four small satellite cones are located on the SW side, and two others occur on the NE flank. The only confirmed historical activity was a long-term late-19th to early 20th-century eruption that provided a beacon for passing ships. Pyroclastic flows that destroyed several villages and caused fatalities reached the coast.",

The southern half of the island is thermally active. It contains fault-related fumarolic areas and hot springs near saltwater Lake Ove along the western coast and along the eastern coast near Mount Patukio, which has a steep-walled summit crater. Grover (1955) noted native accounts of the explosive enlargement of the Ngusunu explosion crater along the SW coast of the island one to two generations prior to 1955, probably after a visit by Guppy in 1882. Press reports mentioned an eruption in the early 1900s that forced the evacuation of villages beside Lake Ove, immediately adjacent to Ngusunu crater.",

Pyroclastic flows and mudflows traveled down valleys from the summit crater to form debris fans along the coast. Thermal areas located in the summit crater, the south to SE flanks, and offshore include areas of steaming ground, fumaroles, small geysers, and hot springs. Spanish explorers arrived in 1568 during the first historical eruption of Savo. Pyroclastic flows during the climactic phase killed almost all inhabitants of the island, and oral traditions also note the expansion of the island on the northern side.

In about 1840, an explosive eruption apparently produced pyroclastic flows that swept all sides of the island, killing its inhabitants. Recorded eruptions have frequently originated from a cone constructed within the large breached crater. These have left the upper flanks and the steep apron of lava flows and volcaniclastic debris within the breach unvegetated.",

A tuff cone was constructed within Lake Voui (or Vui) about 60 years later.

A thick, almost exclusively pyroclastic sequence, initially dacitic then basaltic, overlies lava flows of a pre-caldera shield volcano. The caldera was formed during a major Plinian eruption with dacitic pyroclastic flows about 1,900 years ago. Post-caldera eruptions, primarily from Marum and Benbow cones, have partially filled the caldera floor and produced lava flows that ponded on the floor or overflowed through gaps in the caldera rim. Post-caldera eruptions have also formed a series of scoria cones and maars along a fissure system oriented ENE-WSW. Eruptions have apparently occurred almost yearly during historical time from cones within the caldera or from flank vents. However, from 1850 to 1950, reporting was mostly limited to extra-caldera eruptions that would have affected local populations.",

The basaltic-to-andesitic volcano has been active during historical time at both summit and flank vents, primarily along a NW-SE-trending fissure that cuts across the island, producing moderate explosive eruptions and lava flows that reached the coast. Historical eruptions at the 1413-m-high volcano date back to the mid-19th century. The island was evacuated following major eruptions in 1939 and 1960. The latter eruption, from a NW-flank fissure vent, produced a pyroclastic flow that swept to the sea and a lava flow that formed a new peninsula on the western coast.",

Three cones (1-1.5 basal diameter), known as Epi A, Epi B (or Cioan), and Epi C, are located along the northern rim of the inferred caldera, though Beier et al. (2018) suggest an alternate to the post-caldera formation model. A few smaller cones are south of Epi B. Ephemeral islands were formed during eruptions at Epi B in 1920 and 1953. Explosive activity was reported in 1958 and 1960, discolored water was often seen during 1971-1974 and 1988, a new vent was detected in 1979, and explosive activity occurred in 1999, 2002, 2004, and 2023. The summit was at 34 m below sea level at the time of a 2001 survey, and a research cruise in 2013 (R/V Sonne SO-229; Haase et al, 2013) sampled six cones, including \"very fresh pumice and lava bombs\" from Epi B and \"relatively old-looking\" material from the others. The SO-229 cruise also recovered rhyodacitic pumice with mafic streaks, similar to that sampled by previous cruises, and described Epi B as \"covered by massive blocks of pumice.\"",

Late-Pleistocene to Holocene eruptions are characterized by small volume and low explosivity.

The latest of these produced the Young Toba Tuff (YTT) about 74,000 years ago from vents at the NW and SE ends of present-day Lake Toba. The YTT represents the largest known Quaternary eruption, ejecting about 3,800 km3 (dense rock equivalent) of ash that covered ~40 million km2 to a depth greater than 5 mm, plus another 1,500 km3 of pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits (Costa et al., 2014). Resurgent doming formed the massive Samosir Island and Uluan Peninsula structural blocks after the YTT eruption. Additional post-YTT eruptions include emplacement of a series of lava domes, growth of the solfatarically active Pusukbukit volcano on the south margin of the caldera, and formation of Tandukbenua volcano at the NW-most rim of the caldera. Lack of vegetation suggests that Tandukbenua may be only a few hundred years old (Chesner and Rose, 1991).",

Remnants of that volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently the Rakata, Danan, and Perbuwatan cones were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan, and left only a remnant of Rakata. This eruption caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java. Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former Danan and Perbuwatan cones. Anak Krakatau has been the site of frequent eruptions since 1927.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Ujung Kulon National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Younger pyroclastics from Gunung Putri-Eweranda overlap the Talagabodas products in the north. The crater of Talagabodas has shifted 1.3 km north from the summit crater of Canar and contains a large sulfur-saturated lake. Fumaroles, mud pots, and a warm spring are found around the lake, which has an elevated temperature. The age of the most recent eruption is not known. Changes in lake color occurred in 1913 and 1921, and expanded solfataric activity was reported in 1927. Suffocating gases have frequently killed animals that have wandered into the Pajagalan valley on the NE flank and the Kawah Saat geothermal area south of the crater lake. The Kawah Karaha fumaroles 9 km N are also part of the geothermal system (Tripp et al., 2002).",

Growth of Old Merapi during the Pleistocene ended with major edifice collapse perhaps about 2,000 years ago, leaving a large arcuate scarp cutting the eroded older Batulawang volcano. Subsequent growth of the steep-sided Young Merapi edifice, its upper part unvegetated due to frequent activity, began SW of the earlier collapse scarp. Pyroclastic flows and lahars accompanying growth and collapse of the steep-sided active summit lava dome have devastated cultivated lands on the western-to-southern flanks and caused many fatalities.",

Conflicting late-Pleistocene to Holocene dates for these maars leave uncertainties about their ages, but their youthful morphology in surrounding eroded terrain suggests Holocene activity, possibly as young as several thousand years (McBirney et al., 2003).",

Eruptive activity has in general migrated in a clockwise direction around the summit vent complex. More than 30 eruptions have been recorded since 1000 CE. The ejection of water from the crater lake during the typically short but violent eruptions has created pyroclastic flows and lahars that have caused widespread fatalities and destruction. After more than 5,000 people were killed during an eruption in 1919, an engineering project to drain the crater lake lowered the surface by more than 50 m. The 1951 eruption deepened the crater by 70 m, leaving 50 million cubic meters of water after the damaged drainage tunnels were repaired. Following more than 200 deaths in the 1966 eruption, a new deeper tunnel was constructed, and the lake's volume before the 1990 eruption was only about 1 million cubic meters.",

Gunung Semeru was constructed south of the overlapping Ajek-ajek and Jambangan calderas. A line of lake-filled maars was constructed along a N-S trend cutting through the summit, and cinder cones and lava domes occupy the eastern and NE flanks. Summit topography is complicated by the shifting of craters from NW to SE. Frequent 19th and 20th century eruptions were dominated by small-to-moderate explosions from the summit crater, with occasional lava flows and larger explosive eruptions accompanied by pyroclastic flows that have reached the lower flanks of the volcano.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Bromo Tengger Semeru-Arjuno, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

The most recent of the calderas is the 9 x 10 km wide Sandsea caldera at the SW end of the complex, which formed incrementally during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. An overlapping cluster of post-caldera cones was constructed on the floor of the Sandsea caldera within the past several thousand years.

The inner 6.4 x 9.4 km caldera was formed about 20,150 years ago during eruption of the Gunungkawi Ignimbrite. The SE wall of the inner caldera lies beneath Lake Batur; Batur cone has been constructed within the inner caldera to a height above the outer caldera rim. The Batur stratovolcano has produced vents over much of the inner caldera, but a NE-SW fissure system has localized the Batur I, II, and III craters along the summit ridge. Recorded eruptions have been characterized by mild-to-moderate explosive activity sometimes accompanied by lava emission. Basaltic lava flows from both summit and flank vents have reached the caldera floor and the shores of Lake Batur in historical time.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Batur, a UNESCO Global Geopark property.",

Late-Pleistocene lava flows largely filled the early caldera, after which activity changed to dominantly explosive eruptions during the early Holocene. Tambora was the source of history's largest explosive eruption, in April 1815. Pyroclastic flows reached the sea on all sides of the peninsula, and heavy tephra fall devastated croplands, causing an estimated 60,000 fatalities. The eruption of an estimated more than 150 km3 of tephra formed a 6-km-wide, 1250-m-deep caldera and produced global climatic effects. Minor lava domes and flows have been extruded on the caldera floor at Tambora during the 19th and 20th centuries.",

To the north is Tangkoko (also known as Tongkoko), with a large caldera (~3 x 1.5 km) elongated towards the SE from the highest rim point; the rim at the opposite end is more than 400 m lower. Eruptions occurred from the summit crater in the 17th century and in 1801, when the caldera also reportedly contained a cone surrounded by a lake. About 1.5 km down the outer E flank is the Batuangus (or Batu Angus) lava dome, formed in 1801, along with an adjacent vent (Baru Batuangus) that has been the source of all subsequent eruptions. The higher twin-peaked Duasudara (also Dua Suadara) stratovolcano is about 4.5 km SW of the Tangkoko summit. A NE-facing open crater appears to have a hummocky debris flow that reaches the base of the Tangkoko edifice.",

Three cones, progressively younger to the north, form the summit. Several maars and vents define a rift zone, parallel to the Halmahera island arc, that cuts the volcano; the S-flank Ngade maar formed after about 14,500–13,000 cal. BP (Faral et al., 2022). Eruptions, recorded frequently since the 16th century, typically originated from the summit craters, although flank eruptions have occurred in 1763, 1770, 1775, and 1962-63.",

The 1641 eruption included the emplacement of voluminous pyroclastic flows and lahars and resulted in the formation of the summit caldera.

A younger stage involved the eruption of the Paloc pyroclastic deposits from the late-Pleistocene to Holocene and the formation of the caldera. Radiocarbon dates ranging from about 6,000 to 1,800 years ago were obtained from the Paloc pyroclastic deposits.

This andesitic-to-rhyolitic volcano contains several lava domes, including Mt. Vulcan on its NW flank. Major eruptions during 1871-75 and 1948-53 formed flank lava domes at Hibok-Hibok and produced pyroclastic flows that devastated coastal villages.",

Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel far down the flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the approximately 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often damaged populated lowland areas. A violent eruption in 1814 killed more than 1,200 people and devastated several towns.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Albay, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve property.",

A large breached crater open to the SE was formed as a result of a major debris avalanche that buried several villages and formed a broad hummocky deposit across the plain south of Lake Buhi. This catastrophic event was at one time considered to have occurred during 1628 CE, but later work has shown that the collapse occurred earlier at some unknown date during the Holocene. An older debris avalanche deposit of similar size was also described SW of the volcano (Paguican et al., 2010). Both debris avalanche deposits cover wide areas of low, waterlogged plains, to a distance of ~16 km for the older and 12 km for the younger. The collapse orientation and deposit constituents for both are consistent with being a response to transtensional faulting and gravity spreading. A cone and lava covering about 9 km2 post-date the younger collapse.",

The 2-km-wide, 600-m-deep summit crater of Banahaw is open to the SSW and contained a crater lake until 1730, when it drained, forming mudflows.

Caldera formation lowered the height of the summit by more than 300 m. Although the eruption caused hundreds of fatalities and major damage with severe social and economic impact, successful monitoring efforts greatly reduced the number of fatalities. Widespread lahars that redistributed products of the 1991 eruption have continued to cause severe disruption. Previous major eruptive periods, interrupted by lengthy quiescent periods, have produced pyroclastic flows and lahars that were even more extensive than in 1991.",

Additional submarine cones occur between Ile des Cendres and the Vietnam mainland (Bondarenko and Nadezhnyi, 1989). In 1880 there was a reef (named Veteran) reported about 36 km S, described as being 34 km SSE of Grand Catwick Rock (Round Island).

A 1.6-km-wide, 850-m-deep crater is widely breached to the NW as a result of slope failure. A debris avalanche deposit (3 km3) covers an area of 27 km2 N of the breach. The pyroclastic flow and debris avalanche deposits overlie a paleosol 14C dated around 8,500 cal BP, so Belousov et al. (2018) placed the last eruption at approximately 8,000 cal BP. Local legends describe \"a great earthquake\" when the cone of Popa \"rose from the plains\" in 442 BCE (Belousov et al., 2018, citing Bell, 1907), but there is no physical evidence of an eruption that recent. The steep Taung Kalat lava plug on the WSW flank is famous for the monastery built on top.",

The youngest volcanism in the 600 km2 field occurred in two stages during the early and late Holocene. Volcanic cones at the northern end of the field are sparsely vegetated and have clearly visible lava flows. Three basaltic-andesite centers, Dayinshshan, Maanshan, and possibly Heikongshan, are of Holocene age. An unconfirmed explosive eruption took place in 1609 CE, and there are unconfirmed reports of eruptions during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911 CE).

Accounts during the time of King Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty (1775-1795 CE) noted a lava flow on the mountain. Observations from ships in 1853 were likely from this location.

One of Japan's most frequently active volcanoes, it was in a state of intermittent Strombolian activity from Otake, the NE summit crater, between 1949 and 1996, after which periods of inactivity lengthened. The largest recorded eruption took place in 1813-14, when thick scoria deposits blanketed residential areas, and the SW crater produced two lava flows that reached the western coast. At the end of the eruption the summit of Otake collapsed, forming a large debris avalanche and creating the open Sakuchi caldera, which extends to the eastern coast. The island remained uninhabited for about 70 years after the 1813-1814 eruption. Lava flows reached the eastern coast of the island in 1884. Only about 50 people live on the island.",

The eruption devastated southern and central Kyushu, which remained uninhabited for several centuries. Post-caldera eruptions formed Iodake (or Iwo-dake) lava dome and Inamuradake scoria cone, as well as submarine lava domes. Recorded eruptions have occurred at or near Satsuma-Iojima (also known as Tokara-Iojima), a small 3 x 6 km island forming part of the NW caldera rim. Showa-Iojima lava dome (also known as Iojima-Shinto), a small island 2 km E of Satsuma-Iojima, was formed during submarine eruptions in 1934 and 1935.

The symmetrical andesitic Kaimondake is the most prominent feature, and is capped by a lava dome. Ibusuki has been very active during the Holocene, forming the Ikeda caldera about 4,600 years ago, numerous maars and lava domes. Kaimondake formed during the last 4,000 years, from which all eruptive activity has occurred after about 2,650 years ago. Its last eruption took place in the 9th century.

The smaller Wakamiko caldera was formed during the early Holocene in the NE corner of the caldera, along with several post-caldera cones. The construction of Sakurajima began about 13,000 years ago on the southern rim and built an island that was joined to the Osumi Peninsula during the major explosive and effusive eruption of 1914. Activity at the Kitadake summit cone ended about 4,850 years ago, after which eruptions took place at Minamidake. Frequent eruptions since the 8th century have deposited ash on the city of Kagoshima, located across Kagoshima Bay only 8 km from the summit. The largest recorded eruption took place during 1471-76.",

Several other cones have been active during the Holocene, including the Kometsuka scoria cone as recently as about 210 CE. Historical eruptions have largely consisted of basaltic to basaltic-andesite ash emission with periodic strombolian and phreatomagmatic activity.

Pyroclastic flows dominated during older eruptions, whereas lava domes and lava flows are most common in more recent eruptions. An eruption about 2,200 years ago from Yufudake began with collapse of the N flank that produced a debris avalanche and was followed by lava dome growth and associated pyroclastic flows. The most recent known eruption was from Tsurumi in 867 CE, when there was explosive activity from the summit area.

About 70 subaerial monogenetic volcanoes formed during the last 140,000 years, and chemically similar submarine cones are located offshore. These volcanoes are located on a basement of late-Tertiary volcanic rocks and related sediments and on the flanks of three Quaternary stratovolcanoes: Amagi, Tenshi, and Usami. Some eruptive vents are controlled by fissure systems trending NW-SE or NE-SW. Thirteen eruptive episodes have been documented during the past 32,000 years. Kawagodaira maar produced pyroclastic flows during the largest Holocene eruption about 3,000 years ago. The latest eruption occurred in 1989, when a small submarine crater was formed NE of Ito City.",

Scenic Lake Ashi lies between the SW caldera wall and a half dozen post-caldera lava domes that were constructed along a NW-SE trend cutting through the center of the calderas. Dome growth occurred progressively to the NW, and the largest and youngest of these, Kamiyama, forms the high point. The calderas are breached to the east by the Hayakawa canyon. A phreatic explosion about 3000 years ago was followed by collapse of the NW side of Kamiyama, damming the Hayakawa valley and creating Lake Ashi. The latest magmatic eruptive activity about 2900 years ago produced a pyroclastic flow and a lava dome in the explosion crater, although phreatic eruptions took place as recently as the 12-13th centuries CE. Seismic swarms have occurred during the 20th century. Lake Ashi, along with the thermal areas in the caldera, is a popular resort destination SW of Tokyo.",

Growth of the Younger Fuji volcano began with a period of voluminous lava flows from 11,000 to 8000 years before present (BP), accounting for four-fifths of the volume of the Younger Fuji volcano. Minor explosive eruptions dominated activity from 8000 to 4500 BP, with another period of major lava flows occurring from 4500 to 3000 BP. Subsequently, intermittent major explosive eruptions occurred, with subordinate lava flows and small pyroclastic flows. Summit eruptions dominated from 3000 to 2000 BP, after which flank vents were active. The extensive basaltic lava flows from the summit and some of the more than 100 flank cones and vents blocked drainages against the Tertiary Misaka Mountains on the north side of the volcano, forming the Fuji Five Lakes, popular resort destinations. The last confirmed eruption of this dominantly basaltic volcano in 1707 was Fuji's largest during historical time. It deposited ash on Edo (Tokyo) and formed a large new crater on the east flank.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Fujisan, sacred place and source of artistic inspiration, a UNESCO World Heritage property.",

Ascending this volcano is one of the major objects of religious pilgrimage in central Japan. It is constructed within a largely buried 4 x 5 km caldera and occupies the southern end of the Norikura volcanic zone, which extends northward to Yakedake volcano. The older volcanic complex consisted of at least four major stratovolcanoes constructed from about 680,000 to about 420,000 years ago, after which Ontakesan was inactive for more than 300,000 years. The broad, elongated summit of the younger edifice is cut by a series of small explosion craters along a NNE-trending line. Several phreatic eruptions post-date the roughly 7300-year-old Akahoya tephra from Kikai caldera. The first historical eruption took place in 1979 from fissures near the summit. A non-eruptive landslide in 1984 produced a debris avalanche and lahar that swept down valleys south and east of the volcano. Very minor phreatic activity caused a dusting of ash near the summit in 1991 and 2007. A significant phreatic explosion in September 2014, when a large number of hikers were at or near the summit, resulted in many fatalities.",

Three major eruptions in the past 1,000 years have produced pyroclastic flows and lava flows that traveled mainly down the Hayakawa river valley to the N and NW. The first of these eruptions, in 887 CE (and possibly 989 CE), produced the Hayakawa pyroclastic flow, which reached the coast, and the massive Mae-yama lava flow, which traveled about 6.5 km down the Hayakawa river valley. The summit lava dome was emplaced during the 1361 CE eruption, and the last magmatic eruption took place in 1773 CE. Eruptive activity since 1773 has consisted of relatively minor phreatic explosions from several radial fissures and explosion craters that cut the summit and flanks of the dome.",

The modern Maekake cone forms the summit and is situated east of the remnant of an older andesitic volcano, Kurofuyama, which was destroyed by a late-Pleistocene landslide about 20,000 years before present (BP). Growth of a dacitic shield volcano was accompanied by pumiceous pyroclastic flows, the largest of which occurred about 14,000-11,000 BP, and by growth of the Ko-Asamayama lava dome on the east flank. Maekake, capped by the Kamayama pyroclastic cone that forms the present summit, is probably only a few thousand years old and has observed activity dating back at least to the 11th century CE. Maekake has had several major Plinian eruptions, the last two of which occurred in 1108 (Asamayama's largest Holocene eruption) and 1783 CE.",

The Pleistocene Oshi pyroclastic flow produced extensive welded tuffs and non-welded pumice that covers much of the E, S, and SW flanks. The latest eruptive stage began about 14,000 years ago. Historical eruptions have consisted of phreatic explosions from the acidic crater lakes or their margins. Fumaroles and hot springs that dot the flanks have strongly acidified many rivers draining from the volcano. The crater was the site of active sulfur mining for many years during the 19th and 20th centuries.",

Eruptions along this fissure initially produced the phreatic Takahara-Uenohara tephra deposit, which was distributed primarily to the east.

Activity during the last 55,000 years included the collapse of Asahidake volcano about 30-40,000 years ago producing the massive Ofujisan debris-avalanche deposit, which blankets a broad area SE of the volcano. The youngest volcano, Chausudake, began forming about 16,000 years ago. Six magmatic eruptions took place since then, the latest in 1408-1410, when the youngest summit lava dome, Chausudake, was formed. These eruptions produced block-and-ash flows and concluded with the extrusion of lava flows. Smaller phreatic eruptions have occurred every few hundred years during the past 5000 years.",

The last magmatic eruption took place more than 25,000 years ago, but four major phreatic eruptions have occurred during the past 5,000 years, most recently in 806 and 1888 CE. Seen from the south, Bandaisan presents a conical profile, but much of the north side of the volcano is missing as a result of the collapse of Kobandaisan during the 1888 eruption, causing a debris avalanche that buried several villages and formed several large lakes.",

Ninomegata and Sannomegata are located immediately east and south of Toga Bay (Togowan), which itself is a maar. The rim of the rhyolitic Toga (Togowan) maar, larger than the Megata maars, is breached by the sea on the western side and was formed about 450,000 years ago. The Megata maars are mostly late Pleistocene in age, but Murayama (1987) noted that pottery from roughly 4000 years before present (Jomon Period) has been found within tephra layers from the maars.",

Following late-Pleistocene andesitic-to-rhyolitic caldera-forming eruptions, the basaltic Ninokura stratovolcano grew in the SSE section of the caldera. Successive dacitic-to-rhyolitic explosive eruptions from the Goshikiiwa cone led to the formation of the roughly 2-km-wide Nakanoumi caldera, whose SW and NE rims form peninsulas extending into Lake Towada. The andesitic-to-dacitic Ogurayama lava dome was built over the NE rim of Nakanoumi. The latest eruption took place in 915 CE, when eruptions from Ogurayama produced widespread ashfall and pyroclastic flows.",

The youngest and largest of the 18 lava domes, 574-m-high Tenjoyama, occupies the central portion of the island. Most of the older domes, some of which are Holocene in age, flank Tenjoyama to the north, although late-Pleistocene domes are also found at the southern end of the island. Only two possible historical eruptions, from the 9th century, are known. A lava flow may have reached the sea during an eruption in 832 CE. Tenjosan lava dome was formed during a major eruption in 838 CE that also produced pyroclastic flows and surges. Earthquake swarms took place during the 20th century.",

The basaltic volcano is truncated by small summit calderas, one of which, 3.5 km wide, was formed during a major eruption about 2,500 years ago. Parasitic craters and vents, including maars near the coast and radially oriented fissure vents, dot the flanks of the volcano. Frequent historical eruptions have occurred since 1085 CE at vents ranging from the summit to below sea level, causing much damage on this small populated island. After a three-century-long hiatus ending in 1469, activity has been dominated by flank fissure eruptions sometimes accompanied by minor summit eruptions. A 1.6-km-wide summit caldera was slowly formed by subsidence during an eruption in 2000; by October of that year the crater floor had dropped to only 230 m above sea level.",

Growth of the volcano began with construction of the Kurosaki stratovolcano in the NW part of the island, after which the main stratovolcano began growing in the SE. Both summit and flank vents produced pyroclastic surges and lava flows. Late in the construction of the main cone a 1-1.5 km crater was formed on the SE flank. About 3000 years ago pyroclastic surges swept over the entire island. During about the next 600 years, lava flows and scoria deposits filled the SE crater, which also collapsed repeatedly. The current Ikenosawa crater was considered by Takada et al. (1992) to have formed by ring collapse at the time of a debris avalanche, after which the volcano was quiescent until the eruptions of historical time.",

The high point on the western rim is a pumice-mantled remnant of the pre-collapse volcanic complex that reaches a depth of 360 m. The caldera walls reveal rhyolitic lava flows, shallow intrusions, and volcaniclastic deposits. A voluminous blanket of coarse rhyolitic pumice from the caldera-forming eruption mantles the rim and outer flanks. Post-caldera eruptions formed a lava dome that rises 250 m above the caldera floor. The age of the caldera is not known, but was considered by Fiske et al. (2001) to perhaps be as young as a few thousand years. An active hydrothermal vent field lies on the eastern caldera floor and has produced a polymetallic sulfide deposit from vent chimneys up to 30 m high that emit fluids as hot as 278 degrees C.",

Most eruptions recorded since the late-19th century have occurred from the dacitic post-caldera Myojinsho lava dome on the NE caldera rim. Deposits from submarine pyroclastic flows associated with growth of the dome cover it and extend both into the NE part of the caldera and down its outer slopes. An explosive submarine eruption from Myojinsho in 1952 destroyed a Japanese research vessel, killing all 31 on board. Submarine eruptions have also been observed from other points on the caldera rim and outside of the caldera. The Beyonesu Rocks were named after the French warship the Bayonnaise, which was surveying volcanic islands south of Tokyo Bay in 1850.",

The caldera was formed between about 60,000 and 30,000 years ago. The Shirane dacitic central cone, 3 km wide and 800 m high, rises to within 8 m of the ocean surface in the eastern side of the caldera, whose 600-700 m walls and outer flanks expose basaltic, andesitic, and rhyolitic rocks. Two large submarine cones, Sumisu Knolls No. 1 and 2, lie west of the caldera. Submarine eruptions have been reported from a number of locations near Sumisujima, the last of which occurred in 1916. Water discoloration has frequently been observed since the 1970's. In October 1992 a 6-km-long zone of discolored water was seen extending from the shallow Shirane rock mass near the eastern rim of the caldera, which rises to within 7 m of the ocean surface and is the youngest feature of the volcanic complex.",

The triangular, low-elevation, 8-km-long island narrows toward its SW tip and has produced trachyandesitic and trachytic rocks that are more alkalic than those of other volcanoes in this arc. The island has undergone uplift for at least the past 700 years, accompanying resurgent doming of the caldera; a shoreline landed upon by Captain Cook's surveying crew in 1779 is now 40 m above sea level. The Motoyama plateau on the NE half of the island consists of submarine tuffs overlain by coral deposits and forms the island's high point. Many fumaroles are oriented along a NE-SW zone cutting through Motoyama. Numerous recorded phreatic eruptions, many from vents on the W and NW sides of the island, have accompanied the uplift.",

It rises from about 3,000 m depth to within 170 m of the ocean surface. Two subsidiary cones are located low on the E flank. The morphology is more complex than Kasuga 1 to the north, and prominent ridges separate slopes of interspersed volcaniclastic and lava flow fields. Radiometric dating indicates an age of less than 8,000 years and probably less than 1,000 years; radium/thorium disequilibrium ratios suggest the flows may be only a few centuries old (Fryer et al., 1997). Active hydrothermal vents are located at the summit, at the base of summit ridges, and on the lower flanks.",

The Maug Islands form a twin volcanic massif with Supply Reef, about 11 km N. The truncated inner walls of the caldera on all three islands expose lava flows and pyroclastic deposits that are cut by radial dikes; bedded ash deposits overlie the outer flanks of the islands. No eruptions are known since the discovery of the islands by Espinosa in 1522. The presence of poorly developed coral reefs and coral on the central lava dome suggests a long period of general quiescence, although it does not exclude mild eruptions (Corwin, 1971).

North Pagan at the NE end of the island rises above the flat floor of the northern caldera, which may have formed less than 1,000 years ago. South Pagan is a stratovolcano with an elongated summit containing four distinct craters. Almost all of the recorded eruptions, which date back to the 17th century, have originated from North Pagan. The largest eruption during historical time took place in 1981 and prompted the evacuation of the sparsely populated island.",

The summit of the basaltic-to-andesitic edifice of Usu is cut by a somma formed about 20-30,000 years ago when collapse of the volcano produced a debris avalanche that reached the sea. Dacitic domes erupted along two NW-SE-trending lines fill and flank the summit caldera. Three of these domes, O-Usu, Ko-Usu and Showashinzan, along with seven crypto-domes, were erupted during historical time. The 1663 eruption of Usu was one of the largest in Hokkaido during historical time. The war-time growth of Showashinzan from 1943-45 was painstakingly documented by the local postmaster, who created the first detailed record of growth of a lava dome.\n\nThis volcano is located within the Toya Caldera and Usu Volcano, a UNESCO Global Geopark property.",

A major dacitic pumice eruption at the end of the 4th stage about 40,000 years ago resulted in the formation of the 3-km-diameter Kuttara caldera. The caldera cut a basaltic-to-andesitic stratovolcano complex, which late in its activity produced two major andesitic lava flows on its north side at Kita-yama. Explosions, probably in early Holocene time, formed two large craters on the west flank of the caldera, and a dacitic lava dome was emplaced about 10,000 years ago. Late-stage phreatic explosion products from Jigoku-dani, a 300-400 m wide crater south of the lava dome, overlie the 1663 tephra from Usu volcano. Jigoku-dani and Noboribetsu Spa are the sites of intense thermal activity, including fumaroles, hot springs, and geysers.",

Pyroclastic-flow deposits from Tarumaesan extend nearly to the Pacific coast. Two other Holocene post-caldera volcanoes, Fuppushidake (adjacent to Tarumaesan) and Eniwadake (on the opposite side of the caldera), occur on a line trending NW from Tarumaesan, and were constructed just inside the caldera rim. Minor eruptions took place from the summit of Eniwadake as late as the 17th century. The summit of Tarumaesan contains a small 1.5-km-wide caldera formed during two of Hokkaido's largest historical eruptions, in 1667 and 1739. Tarumaesan is now capped by a flat-topped summit lava dome that formed in 1909.",

These volcanoes overlap the SW rim and SW caldera floor of the Pleistocene Tokachimitsumata caldera. The highest peak in the complex is Nipesotsuyama stratovolcano, which was active during the mid-Pleistocene, about 0.4-0.2 million years ago. The Maruyama stratovolcano and lava dome at the southern end of the complex was discovered to be a Quaternary volcano only in 1989. It is also referred to as Higashi-Tokachi-Maruyama to distinguish it from several other volcanoes named Maruyama, which means \"Round Mountain.\" A minor phreatic eruption took place at the Maruyama lava dome in 1898, and fumaroles are present on one of its summit craters.",

Conical Oakandake was frequently active during the Holocene. The 1-km-wide Nakamachineshiri crater of Meakandake was formed during a major pumice-and-scoria eruption about 13,500 years ago. Within the Akan volcanic complex, only the Meakandake group, east of Lake Akan, has been historically active, producing mild phreatic eruptions since the beginning of the 19th century. Meakandake is composed of nine overlapping cones. The main cone of Meakandake proper has a triple crater at its summit. Historical eruptions at Meakandake have consisted of minor phreatic explosions, but four major magmatic eruptions including pyroclastic flows have occurred during the Holocene.",

Young lava flows descend the NW flank and broad areas along the SE flank, and an older lava flow traveled about 9 km W, reaching the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk along a broad front. Eruptions produced pumiceous tephras with associated pyroclastic flows about 2200, 1400, and 800 years ago. Recent work has documented a pyroclastic-flow deposit that overlies the 1739 tephra from Tarumai volcano in SW Hokkaido.
